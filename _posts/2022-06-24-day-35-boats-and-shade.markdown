Still not 100% back to my normal sleeping schedule, but up and around at 0700. Had some iced coffee at home to offset
all the money I have been spending on takeout coffee and pastries. Meditated for a little while on a few topics, then
decided to play video games for awhile.

Later that morning I took a boat out from Brittingham Boats and made my way from Brittingham Bay to Lake Monona. The
bay is good for boating, but is kind of gross to swim in because of all the thick vegetation. Once I found a clear
area on the lake, I hopped off the boat for some swimming. This was a minor victory for me because I'm not always keen
on swimming in lakes (because they're kind of gross), and I can be a wimp about jumping into cold water. But I cowboyed
up and dove straight in. The water really wasn't that bad past the initial shock, and I paddled around the boat for
awhile.

Lake Monona is a cool place to swim because you are surrounded by the lake and nature, but all within some really cool
views of the Madison skyline too.

After boating, Cassie and I went to get lunch at Echo Tap. I had worked up a real appetite from all the boating and
swimming, so I was pretty psyched. I got the Friday fish fry, some decent cod. There were a few issues, but one has
to manage expectations when eating at the Echo Tap. It is first and foremost a bar, that just so happens to serve
some food. If you think of it that way, you'll never be disappointed.

Food service tangent aside, I also decided to get some beers over lunch. It was great to have some good American
microbrews, and it had been a long time since I'd had lunch beers. It was fun.

I had gotten a little sunburned the day before and tried to put sunblock in just the right areas to even things out.
And I wasn't in strong sun, nor was I in the sun for very long. But somehow I got sunburned in some new spots,
and my face was starting to get a bit burned in spite of the sunscreen. I decided to spend the rest of the day indoors
hiding in the shade. I played video games, watched some movies, and read part of my Bosch book.

We had frozen pizza for dinner and settled into our normal weeknight routine of watching silly game shows like Wheel
of Fortune. I spent the rest of the night watching TV while trying to take care of my sunburns. Managed to stay up
until 2230 in an effort to continue settling back into GMT-5 time.
