* 0700 - took my time getting ready for the day. Dedicated some time to an extra thorough flossing
* 0800 - was planning to walk to a cafe and sit outside for some writing, but the weather was kind of cold. Decided
to stay home, eat some cereal, and play some video games instead
* 0900 - made some pour-over coffee and did some reading
* 1000 - more video games
* 1200 - made a quick lunch at home, nothing fancy. 
* 1230 - headed out for some errands and a hike. Stopped at Target to pick up a couple things, then did a nice 2
mile hike on the Pheasant Branch Trail. Hit the library on the way home and picked up a few random books including one
called "The Common Good" (non-fiction) which I think is a fascinating topic and convenient based on where I left off
in my meditation practice
* 1400 - closed out some notifications on Slack for work in preparation for returning to work
* 1430 - read "The Common Good" for awhile with a beer
* 1630 - got tired from reading, fell asleep for awhile
* 1700 - got up, played video games while Cassie did yoga 
* 1730 - ordered burrito drive for dinner. Played video games while Cassie showered, then took a shower 
* 1830 - ate dinner. Been a long time since I've had burrito drive, it was amazing
* 1930 - read more of "The Common Good"
* 2000 - watched Booksmart and played some board games while drinking palomas
* 2230 - watched some bullshit TV to round out the evening
* 2330 - updated this post and went to bed!
