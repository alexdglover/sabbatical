The plan for today was to lay low, hangout by the pool, and then do something on the north side of the island. The north side is supposedly less touristy and
less developed. We went to breakfast at the hotel (hell yeah, another included breakfast!) and I ate lighter fare. By lighter fare I mean fewer pastries. Tomorrow
the plan is to stick with fruits, juices, and coffee.

We went back up to the room to put on sunblock. While we were away, the hotel staff took our towels and the stuff we left to claim our chairs. In their place was a
little laminated placard saying the lifeguard had our stuff. No lifeguard to be found! 10 minutes later the lifeguard showed up with a cart full of towels. I
showed him the placard and explained I was looking for my stuff. Poor dude tells me that he has no idea where my stuff is, and this happens to him everyday
when he shows up at 1000. I told him it was all good, and I'd try reception. I was getting salty but reception was calm about it and had our stuff. No hay
ninguna problemas.

At this point we were all set in our beach chairs. I spent the morning in the sun catching up on the last three days of posts, including starting this one. A German
fellow came by asking about his stuff, and I explained how I had to go to reception to retrieve mine. Felt good to help him out.

We had a quick lunch next to the pool, where I got some very decent gazpacho. I'm really digging the lighter meals, although to be fair I finished part of Cassie's
veggie burger.
