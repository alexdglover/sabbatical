The plan for today was to lay low, hangout by the pool, and then do something on the north side of the island. The north side is supposedly less touristy and
less developed. We went to breakfast at the hotel (hell yeah, another included breakfast!) and I ate lighter fare. By lighter fare I mean fewer pastries. Tomorrow
the plan is to stick with fruits, juices, and coffee.

We went back up to the room to put on sunblock. While we were away, the hotel staff took our towels and the stuff we left to claim our chairs. In their place was a
little laminated placard saying the lifeguard had our stuff. No lifeguard to be found! 10 minutes later the lifeguard showed up with a cart full of towels. I
showed him the placard and explained I was looking for my stuff. Poor dude tells me that he has no idea where my stuff is, and this happens to him everyday
when he shows up at 1000. I told him it was all good, and I'd try reception. I was getting salty but reception was calm about it and had our stuff. No hay
ninguna problemas.

At this point we were all set in our beach chairs. I spent the morning in the sun catching up on the last three days of posts, including starting this one. A German
fellow came by asking about his stuff, and I explained how I had to go to reception to retrieve mine. Felt good to help him out.

We had a quick lunch next to the pool, where I got some very decent gazpacho. I'm really digging the lighter meals, although to be fair I finished part of Cassie's
veggie burger. 

We continued reading, listening to music, whatever poolside for the afternoon. At 1630 we went to get cleaned up for our little excursion to the north side of the
island. We drove all the way up to a tiny town called De√≠a where some rich artists hang out, but the place was tiny. We couldn't practically park anywhere to walk
around and check the place out. The town seemed small enough that we got the gist by driving through, so we turned around and headed back to Valldemossa, a larger
town where our reservation was. This town was very quaint, very chill, we really enjoyed walking around and checking out the stores. We walked for about 30 minutes
until it was time for our reservation. We had to drive back out of town a bit to get to the restaurant. We got wine, vegetarian paella, and some excellent hazelnut
and chocolate cake (torta avellana).

By the time we got back to the hotel we decided to call it an early night.

### Random insights from today's poolside meditations.

Stoicism and Zen have a lot in common. In both practices, the first step is to overcome aversions/desires, even if only briefly. In the absence of those distraction,
the practitioner gets a glimpse of the calmed mind, sees things more holistically, recognizes the flow of the universe is not predicated on their individual thoughts
and actions. Starting from that glimpse, the practitioner doesn't understand the truth yet, but recognizes that, counterintuitively, letting go of the situation actually
improves things. The practitioner understands the value of surrendering, even if they don't know how to surrender yet. So they practice quieting the mind and introspecting,
or try mind-body exercises to return to the state of surrender. The end goal being to fully surrender and live in perfect alignment with the universe, with the inevitable.
Maybe that's too lofty of a goal for the average practitioner. Maybe just improving alignment is enough. I certainly can't see how to fully embody this practice.

I'm reading a book, Hidden Zen, by one of the Rinzai Zen masters. He mentioned that modern life emphasizes visual focus - focus on screens, words, faces - as opposed to the
relaxed, broader view humans might use when hunting in a forest, or looking out for predators. He prescribes exercises where you try to let your view expand to the whole
peripheral vision, and try not to focus on any one thing. I think this is interesting, as it certainly matches personal experience of zoning out only to realize you're able
to see and understand more than your focal point. I'm planning on doing more of this peripheral vision meditation.
