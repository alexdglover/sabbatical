For days 7-9, I was traveling to see folks outside of Madison. I saw all of my brothers, saw both of my parents, saw two friends (
including one who is moving to another state in a few days). This wasn't exactly a feat, but it had been on my goals/to do list for a long
time. I hadn't seen some of these people in years. All in all it felt really good to see everyone.

While visiting with everyone, I watched some TV, wrote one line of C++, spent a lot of time outdoors, and got to eat a lot of good food.
I also got to hang out with my brother's dog, Leo.

I had two realizations, two personal insights over this weekend:

* I have a fear-based relationship with money. Or maybe work. I do this weird thing where I envision my retirement savings as this
repelling force. This force is fighting on my behalf, and also slowly growing (like my savings). I feel that I would get relief from this
anxiety/fear once this force is large enough. I celebrate thoughts of this force getting stronger. This all seems unhealthy, and indicative
of an unhealthy relationship with money
* I believed that I would visit people more often, if only I had more time (specifically if I didn't have to work). I think this is only
partially true - people have their own schedules, their own lives. Just because I might have more time or want to hang out, doesn't mean
other folks will have the time or desire to hang out. While I think I don't see family and friends _enough_, I think I could be better at
staying connected without being retired
