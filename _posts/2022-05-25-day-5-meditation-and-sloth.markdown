Day 5 was earmarked as an indoor day. Rain forecasted for basically the entire day. I managed to take a walk to a coffee shop
before the rain came, but was otherwise pretty lazy all day.

* 0730 - walked to Wonderstate coffee. Drank coffee while doing some reflecting and writing. Thought a lot about purpose, whether it is necessary,
whether it can be chosen arbitrarily. Decided looking for purpose was another form of unnecessary desire. Having a purpose is a luxury not
a necessity. Purpose is not a prerequisite for contentment
* 0930 - played video games, ate some cereal
* 1200 - had leftover tofu for lunch
* 1230 - drove to the library
* 1300 - did some admin work (email for condo, scheduled next Spanish lesson)
* 1400 - watched a movie
* 1600 - shaved my head and face, showered
* 1700 - talked to my brother Greg on the phone. Had some tea
* 1800 - made veggie burritos for dinner
* 1900 - made dirt, the classic chocolate pudding dessert with Oreo crumbles. Watched TV
* 2100 - cleaned out Cassie's Mazda in preparation for getting it detailed
* 2130 - finally gave up on the pudding setting any better and ate all of it

### Notes on meditation

Meditation for me has two phases. The first is about quieting the internal voice of the id. The voice that says I'm hungry, I'm bored,
I'm anxious. Once done, you realize there is no urgency. You're not going to die if you don't eat this second, or ignore any other
desire for that matter. Your breath is automatic, and you have an abundance of air.

The second phase is using that relaxation, that calmness, to get comfortable with the idea of letting go of control. Instead, focus on being
comfortable with the unknown. Being comfortable with not being in control. If you can do that, dominos start to fall. You realize there is
even more relaxation that comes with letting go. And there is even more relaxation, maybe even elation, when you realize how easy it was to
get to this state of mind. You just do _less_ and observe _more_. 

The paradoxes of meditation make a little bit more sense to me. Knowing the unknown is more about being aware of the
relaxed state that comes from embracing the unknown, letting go. The "unknown" isn't supposed to be quantifiable or knowable secret you can
learn if you meditate hard enough. Letting go is not something you can do or force, but rather through
_not_ doing you achieve a relaxed state of mind. 

I think the first phase I described is the appeal of drugs and alcohol. The mind is quiet, all desires are silenced long enough to
recognize the joy of letting go. Same thing for cigarette breaks. It seems like tobacco (ironically a stimulant) relaxes you. But it has
more to do with quieting the mind long enough to enter a peaceful state.

Mindfulness or meditation won't give you things like purpose or wisdom. It just shows you how silly it is to suffer in
pursuit of these things. The revelations from meditation can hit in waves, like dominos of ideas. You realize the peace
has always been there. That it is the default state of mind. That the id is noisy and appears to be in control, but it's really
just another sensation arising in consciousness.

Because these revelations hit in waves it seems as though all problems can be solved with meditation. My opinion is that it
solves one narrow problem well - bringing focus to the mind, oxymoronically by trying less
hard, thereby allowing the unimportant things to slide from your mind.

All of this is probably "premature enlightenment" but writing it down helped me crystallize some thoughts. I am going to try to focus on
the two phases I described the next time I meditate.
