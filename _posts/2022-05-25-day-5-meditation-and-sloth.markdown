Day 5 was earmarked as an indoor day. Rain forecasted for basically the entire day. I managed to take a walk to a coffee shop
before the rain came, but was otherwise pretty lazy all day.

* 0730 - walked to Wonderstate coffee. Drank coffee will doing some reflecting and writing. Thought a lot about purpose, whether it is necessary,
whether it can be chosen arbitrarily. 
* 0930 - played video games, ate some cereal
* 1200 - had leftover tofu for lunch
* 1230 - drove to the library
* 1300 - did some admin work (email for condo, scheduled next Spanish lesson)
* 1400 - settled down for a movie
* 1600 - shaved my head and face, showered
* 1700 - talked to my brother Greg on the phone. Had some tea
* 1800 - made veggie burritos for dinner
* 1900 - made dirt, the classic chocolate pudding dessert with Oreo crumbles. Watched TV
* 2100 - cleaned out Cassie's Mazda in preparation for getting it detailed
* 2130 - finally gave up on the pudding setting any better and ate all of it


### Notes on meditation

Meditation for me is about quieting the internal voice of the id. The voice that says I'm hungry, I'm bored, I'm anxious.
Once done, the second phase is letting go of control, and focusing on being comfortable with the unknown. Being comfortable
with not being in control. And then finding the relaxation that comes with not only letting go, but recognizing the ease of doing so
once accomplished. The paradoxes of meditation make a little bit more sense to me. Knowing the unknown is more about being aware of the
relaxed state that comes from embracing the unknown, letting go.

I think this is the appeal of drugs and alcohol. The mind is quiet, all desires are silenced long enough to recognize the joy of letting go.
Same thing for cigarette breaks. It seems like tobacco (ironically a stimulant) relaxes you. But it has more to do with quieting the mind
long enough to enter a peaceful state.

Mindfulness or meditation won't give you things like purpose or wisdom. It just shows you how silly it is to suffer in
pursuit of these things. The revelations from meditation can hit in waves, like dominos of ideas. You realize the peace
has always been there. That it is the default state of mind. That the id is noisy and appears to be in control, but it's really
just another sensation arising in consciousness.

Because these revelations hit in waves it seems as though all problems can be solved with meditation. My opinion is that it
solves one narrow problem well - bringing focus to the mind, oxymoronically by trying less
hard, thereby allowing the unimportant things to slide from your mind.
