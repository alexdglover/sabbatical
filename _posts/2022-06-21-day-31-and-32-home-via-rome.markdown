We had a lot of time before our flight, so we did a lazy breakfast (which was awesome), got packed up and checked out,
and hung around the hotel before we had to drive to the airport. I worked on [the previous days blogpost]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-06-19-day-30-checkpoint-2 %})
and was feeling like I was making some real progress in how I think, and how I could further my meditation and related
practices. We drove to the Palma airport and boarded our flight without much issue.

I won't recount all the details for the sake of letting shit go, but my interaction with my fellow humans during the
flight and at the Rome airport (Ciampino) really destroyed most of the empathy and the broader vision I had cultivated
that morning and the day before. I'll chalk some of it up to language barrier - perhaps the people I was interacting
with may have been able to voice themselves better, or if not, maybe I could have had a positive conversation with them
about how they were being shitty, and maybe consider their fellow humans more in the future.

Side note, not the crux of the issue here - European culture (or at least some Europeans) seems to permit or even
encourage a certain amound of disorder. Maintaining orderly lines isn't really a thing, edging another car out of the
way by forcing your way in is common and no one gets upset, hell, there was a huge boulevard in rome that had no lane
lines, and everyone sort of just figured it out. Americans can be shitty about cutting lines or driving badly, but
in the US we do a pretty good job of policing each other. In Europe, it seems that people either don't care as much
or that it is cuturally permissible to do these things.

I think I carried the negative vibes with me a bit, or Cassie and I were just more tapped from our short travel than
I thought. After checking into the hotel, we prioritized goint to visit the Trevi Fountain because it got shut down
the last time we visited Rome. It really is a very cool set of sculptures, and I could see it being a cool place to
hang out if there is ever a time with fewer tourists. The locals seemed to have some kind of tradition of washing
their hands and drinking water from the taps near the fountain, which I thought was cool even without knowing the
details. 

We wandered the city for awhile after that looking for dinner, but it got very busy quickly and we struggled to find
a restaurant we liked that had tables. We were so worn down we ended up eating at a Chinese restaurant of all places
on our last day in Italy. We had eaten so much Italian food everywhere else, it seemed like a minor problem in the
grand scheme.

The next day we checked out of our Rome hotel, made our way to Fiumicino, and flew back home. Our flight departed on
time and actually arrived an hour early. This actually turned out to be bad news - we got stuck on the tarmac waiting
for a gate for over an hour (so we were later than our scheduled arrival at this point), and some terrible confluence
of forces had created a HUGE line at customs at O'Hare. I have never seen a customs line this long. The line snaked
through huge hallways 2 or 3 times, probably a quarter mile long for each length, BEFORE we got to the "normal"
switchback lines area. We were probably in line for nearly 2 hours, after our 9 hour flight and 1 hour on the tarmac.
People were not having a good time.

Travel friction aside, it felt good to be home. The last day or two of our trip I had already started thinking about
all the positive things about home. Sleeping in my own bed, not living out of a suitcase, being back in my home country
with my familiar customs. We were a bit crabby the rest of the drive home, but within reason considering the lack of
sleep and rough note we ended on. We got some Potbelly's sandwiches on the way home which really hit the spot for
some reason, showered when we got home, and I polished off a Jameson-and-coke before going to bed. I was tired enough
that I felt confident there'd be no issue adjusting back to GMT-5 time.
