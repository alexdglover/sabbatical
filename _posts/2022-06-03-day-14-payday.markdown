* 0730 - went on a half mile walk, picked up coffee. Drank my coffee at home and ate the last muffin for breakfast. Also inflated the tires
on Cassie's new bike, and returned the bike pump to our neighbor friends
* 0800 - played video games while working on filling my Kindle and tablet up with content for my upcoming travels
* 0900 - cleaned up some old emails, went through some new movie and book suggestions for new ideas. Got an alert that today is payday!
It's easy to stay relaxed and live a retiree lifestyle when you still have a full time salary coming in. Going to reflect later today on
how I might feel differently if I were no longer working
* 1000 - started reading "Blink" by Malcom Gladwell outside on the patio. Enjoyed all of the sun but eventually got too hot
* 1100 - finished watching "Black Mass" then worked on this blog
* 1200 - lunch!
