Day 12 was a really full day, I feel great about how much I fit into a single day. Good weather and a wide open schedule made it easy to do
a ton of stuff.


* 0730 - meditated. Listened to Tao te Ching. Focused on the paradoxes
* 0830 - made coffee at home, ate a muffin. Played video games
* 0900 - watched part of "Black Mass"
* 1000 - played basketball at Brittingham park. Hit six free throws in a row, plus two back to back three pointers. Excellent day for
shooting hoops
* 1200 - helped a guy jump his car at the park. There's a short story to be told. I was shooting hoops when this fellow walked over, who
had some dirty sweat pants, sort of blood shot eyes. I assumed he was going to ask for money. He asked if I drove to the park - not wanting
to get roped into some scheme or long-winded story with a vagrant, I lied and told him I walked to the park. He asked other folks at the
park if they drove, and I overheard him say he needed to jump his car. I passively watched him, and sure enough, he retired to a VW
Passat or similar. It was about time for me to leave for lunch, and I felt bad for lying to this dude, so I walked over and asked him if
he still needed a jump. I asked if he had cables, to which he replied "I ain't got shit." So I leveled with him, told him I lied, I had a
car with me, but no cables. I told him I'd go home and grab the cables and come back. I returned about 5 minutes later with my car and
cables and we jumped his car on the first try. No muss, no fuss, no car issues. He was very thankful, offered to buy me pizza on his credit
card. Even his passenger said some nice things. I declined all offers, and said jumping cars is just something people need to do for each
other some times. I was really glad I offered to help him.
* 1230 - had lunch with Cassie
* 1330 - walked to a bike shop by the capital. Bought a used bike, a single speed with good upright handlebars. Only $150 for what seems
like a pretty solid bike
* 1500 - rented a kayak at Brittingham park, kayaked around the bay for about an hour
* 1600 - played video games to cool off and fill some time
* 1700 - showered
* 1800 - made an egg scramble for dinner including fried peppers, potatoes, and eggs
* 1900 - played video games
* 2000 - watched TV with Cassie
