I'm kicking off this post first thing in the morning up because I want to capture how cool it is
to wake up to these picturesque views. I thought by now I'd have adapted, and it would just seem mundane.
But no, looking out the windows at the mountains and the quaint little town still makes me smile.

Overall I'm having a lovely morning - slept well, stayed in the warm bed for about an hour, then made some
instant coffee in the hotel room. Decided to listen to some music while I write and got a little hit of
happiness from listening to "Hawaiian Sunset."

Going to get coffee (or a pastry!) first thing in the morning is one of my favorite things to do.
I'm sure I'm not alone in this. But what insights can we take from this? Mornings are quiet. Mornings precede
work and other obligations, usually. I think the main benefit is having some alone time. I think I've spent
enough time alone that I've gotten used to it, accustomed to it. I lived alone for a few years (which I highly
recommend everyone do once in their life). I think pandemic life made it hard for people to get alone time to
decompress, myself included. Ironically the introverts lost their alone time, and extroverts lost their social
time. "When you're by yourself, there ain't nobody else to lie to" or something like that. I think the alone
time is like gestalt therapy, as long as you don't spiral. You can talk to, listen to the different parts of your
mind and get a sense of what you truly believe versus what you're telling yourself, what you're trying to convince
yourself is true. Even if you don't solve anything or find the answer, I think there's value in letting the other
parts of your mind decompress and unburden themselves. Before you decide I'm crazy, go read about how the left and
right brain, when surgically separated, continue to operate independently of each other. No one fully understands
consciousness, but experientially I can say that these other parts of your mind can get compartmentalized, and if
they stay that way for too long, they start to fester.

And it takes a few minutes of reflection to get to that state. I think this is the real benefit of journaling.
Gratitude journals and other prescriptive techniques have their place, but wandering through writing seems to make
space for all parts of your brain to express themselves.

Enough insight for now, time to catalog the rest of the day. After Cassie woke up, we packed, ate breakfast, and did
another watercolor session. It's been an interesting addition to our vacation and it's starting to grow on me. Afterwards
we checked out and started the drive to Zermatt, our next destination. We had a few issues with navigation that set us back,
followed by a lot of serious mountain driving. Cassie was not keen on all the curves, but we did get to see more mountains,
a hydroelectric dam, and a bunch of small waterfalls. All in all this drive was tough but worth it.

We picked up some
premade food at a grocery store while out on the rural roads and had a chat with a lady at the local coffee shop. At first
she seemed upset that we were going to eat our grocery store food at these communal tables, something about picnic laws in
Switzerland. We never did figure out what the problem was, but I bought some coffee and tried to be nice to her, and in the
end we seemed to have won her over. Winning the hearts and minds, keeping America in good favor with the locals.

We ate our food in a parking lot, then started driving again. Finally we got to Tasch, the town where we could pick up the
train to Zermatt. The parking garage was spotless, I've never seen a cleaner or more modern garage. The train ride was a quick
ten minutes, followed by a two minute walk to the hotel. Cassie really nailed the planning for this part of the trip.

The hotel in Wengen was quaint and quite nice. This hotel in Zermatt is _fucking nice_. Wengen is cool if you're looking for a
quieter, more authentic mountain/rural experience. It was more than sufficient. But this hotel is luxe. You can definitely tell
that rich folk come here to ski and vacation. We even have a view of the Matterhorn right from our balcony!

After getting settled, we did a quick hike through town to get a better view of the Matterhorn.

Afterwards, we took showers and
headed to dinner. I got the spaghetti arrabbiata, and the sauce was **amazing**. This was the second time on this trip I would describe
a meal as life changing. I live pretty well - you can serve fine wines, take me to the finest symphonies, get me real drunk, and it
would hardly register on the hedonic meter. But this sauce had me making noises, shaking my head. Holy shit this was good pasta.
I can't wait to eat at this restaurant again. If the other dishes are half as good, it will be a treat.

From dinner, Cassie and I went back to the room, had some champagne, and checked out the views from our hotel.

Now I'm updating this
post before bed. A really solid first day in Zermatt.
