Back in Madison now, the vacation/travel part of my sabbatical is complete. On to phase 3 - wrapping things up, and
enjoying the last ~12 days off.

I was feeling pretty good, didn't seem to have any jet lag to speak of. I woke up once at ~0400 and eventually woke
up for the day around 0700. That's a little early for me, but overall I slept pretty well.

I kicked off the day by hopping on my bike, heading over to Greenbush Bakery for my favorite donuts, and then some
coffee at Indie Coffee. Afterwards I made a list of what I really _should_ be doing over the next few days, plus
reiterating the list of activies I _could_ do with my remaining time. I decided unpacking was the most important task
to tackle. I knew it wouldn't take that long, and leaving clothes in a suitcase for too long is a surefire way to have
a bunch of wrinkly and funky clothes.

By the time I finished unpacking it was almost time for lunch. Cassie had taken the day off, so we decided to take
advantage and walk to one of our all-time favorite restaurants, Himal Chuli. We had great food (as always) and sat in the
sun, despite the heat. On our way back from lunch, we stopped at Capitol Centre grocery store to pick up ingredients
for gazpacho.

We prepared the gazpacho when we got home, with the intention of taking out a boat once the gazpacho was chilling in
the fridge. After all my biking and time in the sun, I was a little tired. We decided to stay home and do some yoga
instead.

Finally we had the gazpacho with some Italian bread and watched some TV.

The jet lag caught up with me at this point and I was really tired. I ended up crashing at like 2000.

While I didn't accomplish a lot, I really enjoyed being back home after vacation. Being in my home, riding my bike,
hitting up some familiar spots, and the autonomy of being on my own was really pleasant. It was a good day.
