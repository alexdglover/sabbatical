My boss,
a sharp dude who is also due to take sabbatical soon, said he was waiting to take his sabbatical until he could "think of how to get the
most value from the experience." While I had lots of rough ideas about what I would do with my sabbatical, his comment motivated me to put
more thought and effort into preparing for my sabbatical. As part of that effort, I'm hoping to document my experience, starting now with
outlining what I want to get out of my sabbatical.

In general, I plan to use my sabbatical for doing the things that I struggle to find time for. Some people are great at time management
and can raise kids, go to the gym, support their community, all while putting 40+ hours a week into their job. I'm not one of those people,
and the more productive I try to be, the more anxiety and the less time affluent I feel. So my sabbatical will be a rare opportunity
to do all those things I feel I never have time for.

Specifically:
* Exercise (running, kayaking, SUPing, biking)
* Spending time outdoors
* Meditation, self reflection
* Creative outlets and hobbies like baking, studying Spanish
* Reading
* Visiting friends and family, especially out of town
* One-off tasks like getting my car washed, home projects that never get done

Secondarily, my wife Cassie will be joining me for part of my sabbatical, but not all of it. I love spending time with my wife, but our
interests don't overlap perfectly. Because she will be working, my sabbatical will be an opportunity to do some of the things she doesn't
enjoy like:
* Waking up early and going to a cafe/diner
* Taking a flying lesson


Besides thinking about the specific activities I want to do, it's important to think about the _outcomes_ I want to get from my sabbatical.

## Outcomes

### Test Hypotheses

A sabbatical is an uncommon opportunity to do some experiments, so one of my desired outcomes is to test some hypotheses.

#### Hypothesis 1 - retired life is great

I'm interested in the [FIRE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp) movement, but have no idea
what retired life would mean for me. Would I still have meaning and fulfillment without a job? Would I stay motivated, or would I just live
hedonistically? Is that really so bad? So one of my desired outcomes is to get firsthand experience with the unemployed lifestyle and learn
about myself from it. My hypothesis is that I will use my unemployed time well, get a lot done, and not just drink beer and play videogames
all day.

As an extension to this hypothesis, I believe I will find time and energy for things I'm excited and passionate about. If my hypothesis is
correct, I expect my sabbatical days to be quite busy. If I'm only obligated to do what I'm excited and passionate about, I should be doing
things all the time!

#### Hypothesis 2 - my anxiety is strictly work related

I have a touch of anxiety. Enough that I sought help recently, but not enough to have full blown panic attacks, use medications, or work
with a psychiatrist (psychologist? I can never keep them straight). Most of my worries are about work, and I spend far too much time
thinking about how I would be free to do any job I want (or no job at all) if only I had enough money. This in turn leads to a spiral of
thinking about work and money. I hypothesize that in the absence of work I will feel less anxiety, and that a long hiatus from work may
help me reset my anxiety such that I feel better when I return to work.

### Get fit

I have no illusions about how much I can improve my physical fitness in only six weeks. However I can measure how many days I get
significant exercise. If I'm successful in exercising over my sabbatical, hopefully some of the habits and/or health benefits will carry
over after the sabbatical ends. Therefore I am setting a goal of exercising (defined as doing any extra physical activity for thirty
minutes or more, even if it's just walking) on 42 of the 45 days of my sabbatical.

### Hablo espa√±ol

Similarly, I can't confidently commit to becoming bilingual or even mastering conversational Spanish in six weeks, but I can measure my
efforts I take towards the goal. I'm planning on using [LanguageConvo.com](https://www.languageconvo.com/) to practice speaking and
listening comprehension. My desired outcome is to complete at least ten 30 minute sessions with a tutor.

### Disconnect

I've been on computers basically nonstop since I was 18. I got my first real IT job when I was 22 in May 2009, almost exactly 13 years ago.
I just want to stop thinking about computers for awhile. My plan is to only use my personal laptop for writing this blog and use my phone
for podcasts and 'administrative' items, otherwise stay off of computers as much as possible. If I'm just killing time browsing the
internet, I'd consider that a sabbatical failure.
