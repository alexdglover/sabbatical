Day 10 happened to be Memorial Day, so some businesses were closed.  Weather was warm but very windy, so windy that Brittingham boats shut
down early which is kind of a bummer for Memorial Day. In hindsight I wish I had done a little bit more with my day.

* 0700 - slept in, felt a little worn down from a weekend in the sun and all the driving
* 0900 - played video games. Did some light cleaning
* 1200 - tried to go to Bandit Taco & Coffee for lunch, but they were closed for the holiday. Settled on Panera as it was next door. Had a
salad, felt great
* 1300 - packed up some supplies for going to Brittingham Park. Spent almost 2 hours reading, shooting hoops, sitting in the sun. Brought
some tea and coke. Was a great time, but was really windy. Too windy to play basketball for very long.

* 1500 - played more video games
* 1800 - walked to the liquor store to get some beer
* 1830 - had leftover pizza and spicy rice noodles from Trader Joe for dinner. Served with Heineken and Super Cluster IPA, paired with a
Brewers-Cub game
* 1930 - got bored with watching baseball. Sat outside on the patio and just appreciated the great weather. Was feeling good from the beer
too. It was amazing
* 2000 - decided to watch a movie with Cassie, "How Do You Know." Not great! But was nice to relax with a movie
