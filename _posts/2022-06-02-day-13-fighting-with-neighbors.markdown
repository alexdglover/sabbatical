* 0730 - made coffee at home, ate another muffin for breakfast
* 0800 - played video games
* 0900 - cleaned up the house
* 1145 - cooked omelettes and breakfast potatoes for lunch
* 1245 - drove Cassie to work
* 1300 - took my bike up to the capital, down state street, then doubled back a bit to get on the bike path.
Took the bike path to a coffee shop a mile or two away. Had a cold coffee and chatted up some strangers. Biked back home
* 1500 - played video games
* 1545 - finished cleaning the house
* 1700 - showered
* 1800 - ate dinner with Cassie
* 1830 - meeting with my condo neighbors. I was a little harsh with some of my neighbors.
This is something I struggle with at work too. Disappointing, but interesting to learn that this
problem isn't unique to work. Not sure if this means I'm a bit of an asshole everywhere, or just that I
should live and work with less group interaction
* 1930 - had some wine and beer with neighbors
* 2100 - watched TV with Cassie then went to bed at 2300
