Today is the midpoint of our vacation, so we needed to do some laundry. Fortunately the weather coincided with our plans again,
as rain was forecasted.

I woke up at 8 and used the time to catch up on some writing (I'm always about a day behind). We took our time having breakfast
and coffee instead of rushing through it. We weren't sure about the forecast, but it seemed the afternoon was going to be worse.
We planned to hike in the morning, then deal with our laundry in the afternoon. We started off on a 40 minute hike and the rain
started a few minutes later. The weather in the mountains seems to change on a whim, and the rain dispersed in just a few minutes.
The hike led us to some unassuming spots that had great views of the entire Lauterbrunnen valley.

It was a really solid hike, saw maybe one other tourist on the way. Lots of wide open space, beautiful views, and peace.

By the time we got back to the hotel, the rain had picked up. We decided to have a quick lunch at the hotel before dealing with
laundry. We waited out the rain a bit, then marched out with our backpacks of laundry to the local laundromat. We needed Swiss
Francs for the machine, and needed to buy soap from the hotel that operated the laundromat, this resulted in a fair amount of
walking. While waiting for the laundry machines, we met several other travellers who were also waiting on the laundry machines.
We made small talk until a machine was available, then we dumped our laundry. The laundry was going to take an hour, so we started
a second hike.

The second hike was to Staubbachbrinkli (another arbitrary destination with good mountain views), and took almost exactly an hour
which was perfect for our laundry situation. The views were from the edge of the valley, looking at the waterfalls on the opposite
side of the valley. Not as good as the first hike, but similarly refreshing in terms of open space and air.

Once were back, we threw our laundry into the dryer, ram into our laundry friends again, then went back to the hotel to wait. I killed
my remaining beer, did some Spanish lessons, and talked about dinner plans. To have a lighter meal, we decided to pick something up at
the local grocery store when we picked up our laundry. When visiting a new place, I love to go to the grocery store. It's the great
equalizer - everyone eats, most cultures have some kind of market, and you get a little snapshot of the locals and their lives in a grocery
store. We got some premade pasta and rice dishes, plus some little cake for dessert.

Our clothes were still wet when we picked them up, but our conversations with the other launderers prepared us for that possibility.
We took everything back to the hotel and hung it up to dry. Fortunately Cassie had requested a fan the previous day (the weather had been
warm, and nobody has air conditioning around here), so we could rig something up to dry the clothes.

We relaxed for awhile, ate our dinner, and decided to cap off the night with some drinks at the bar. We met 3 American couples throughout
the night, all super friendly.

The elevator in our hotel has been unavailable, so each time we left included 5 flights of stairs up and down. Combined with all the hiking
and drinking, I was beat - going to sleep well tonight!
