Meditation for me is about quieting the internal voice of the id. The voice that says I'm hungry, I'm bored, I'm anxious.
Once done, the second phase is letting go of control, and focusing on being comfortable with the unknown. Being comfortable
with not being in control. And then finding the relaxation that comes with not only letting go, but recognizing the ease of doing so
once accomplished. The paradoxes of meditation make a little bit more sense to me. Knowing the unknown is more about being aware of the
relaxed state that comes from embracing the unknown, letting go.

I think this is the appeal of drugs and alcohol. The mind is quiet, all desires are silenced long enough to recognize the joy of letting go.
Same thing for cigarette breaks. It seems like tobacco (ironically a stimulant) relaxes you. But it has more to do with quieting the mind
long enough to enter a peaceful state.

Mindfulness or meditation won't give you things like purpose or wisdom. It just shows you how silly it is to suffer in
pursuit of these things. The revelations from meditation can hit in waves, like dominos of ideas. You realize the peace
has always been there. That it is the default state of mind. That the id is noisy and appears to be in control, but it's really
just another sensation arising in consciousness.

Because these revelations hit in waves it seems as though all problems can be solved with meditation. My opinion is that it
solves one narrow problem well - bringing focus to the mind, oxymoronically by trying less
hard, thereby allowing the unimportant things to slide from your mind.
