The European vacation extravaganza continues. Got breakfast at the hotel (el precio de la habitación
incluye desayuno cada día). Cassie handled some paperwork for our flight to Mallorca while I practiced
Spanish on Duolingo. We headed out a bit late, around 1000, and headed to one of the funicular stations.

The funicular took us part of the way up one of the mountains next to the Matterhorn. Views of the Matterhorn
were great from our new vantage point, and several hiking trails branched off from the station. We took a shorter hike
that took us past two of the lakes on the mountain.

The weather changed quickly - started cold, got so hot I had to change
into shorts, then rained on us on the way back. We took the funicular back down to Zermatt, but the rain was still going
pretty hard. It was already 1400 by then, so we were ready for lunch. Fortunately we stumbled on a restaurant we previously
walked past that looked interesting. It was all serendipitous. We got some hummus avocado sandwiches and a fresh strawberry
pastry. All the food was quite nice. The restaurant also had a ridiculous mascot outside that I was quite fond of.

The rain stopped while we ate lunch. We walked around some of the main street of Zermatt, and picked up a few specialty Swiss
chocolates at a shop. When we got back to the hotel, we spent about an hour relaxing in the hot tub and swimming in the pool.
We had the whole place to ourselves, it was amazing. I tried to soak in the vibes and appreciate just how luxurious the situation
was.

Afterwards we showered up and relaxed at the hotel for a bit. I'm currently working this post and listening to 'chill beats'
(hard to take that name seriously). I'm going to update some of my recent posts with photos and do a watercolor with Cassie
before our dinner reservation at 2030. Maybe I'll get that spaghetti al arabbiata again!
