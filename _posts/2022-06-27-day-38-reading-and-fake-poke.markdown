* 0700 - woke up, had some coffee and cereal
* 0800 - started making pizza dough, using the recipe I got from Tuscany. Think I'm going to kill my stand mixer,
it was really struggling and grinding to knead the dough. Things are meant to be used I guess
* 1000 - went to the park to shoot hoops. Shot much better this time which was a relief after
last session. Couldn't break a streak of 5 free throws, but was hitting 3 or 4 in a row frequently.
Probably shot 50% overall
* 1200 - leftover tacos for lunch
* 1300 - played video games
* 1400 - had a neighbor stop over, they wanted to launch a drone from my patio. Was a normal drone, but
the experience was still a novelty
* 1430 - did some reading on my patio. Finished the second Bosch book
* 1600 - quick yoga session
* 1800 - made some faux-tuna poke bowls (using watermelon instead of raw tuna) with Cassie.
* 1900 - more reading on the patio. Tried to get into some new books, all the reading put me to sleep for a bit
* 2000 - watched another Stranger Things episode. This season is brutal so far, A+
