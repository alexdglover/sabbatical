* 0730 - walked 18 minutes to The Curve diner. Had a nice greasy spoon breakfast of eggs, hash browns,
toast, and coffee. Walked back home. Saw lots of geese and even some goslings.
I swear I'm not trying for some weird bird theme for this sabbatical
* 0900 - free initial Spanish lesson via LanguageConvo.com. Struggled, but the instructor seemed
friendly so I signed up for a real, one hour lesson for tomorrow
* 0930 - did some online Spanish practice lessons
* 1000 - scheduled car detailing, talked to Cassie for awhile
* 1030 - walked to Brittingham park to shoot hoops
    * Going to the park was excellent. Had a pleasant walk to the park and the courts were
initially empty. Had the whole park to myself. The view beyond the hoop is pretty great.
If you look closely, you'll see I wedged my ball against the rim. I laughed rather than raged,
it was great. Managed to knock it loose by throwing my water bottle at it. One of the local F-16
falcons did a low and slow flyover, which felt like a private air show. Shot pretty bad per my usual
but managed to hit 5 free throws in a row which is pretty good for me. Talked to some random in
the park, including a vagrant rambling about how California took down the basketball hoops
after COVID hit
