Finished packing, ate leftover pizza for breakfast. Drove down to the O'Hare area
only to learn the long term parking spot we reserved wouldn't be honored. Business and industry
have learned the power of overcommitting a long time ago, and it makes for a shitty human experience.
Not sure what the lesson learned is. Maybe that I'd like to do whatever the opposite of making life harder
for people is.

We ultimately parked at O'Hare which will cost us like an extra $120 over the course of the trip, but fuck it,
we didn't have a lot of time to waste. Speaking of time to waste, we got through airport transit and security fairly
quickly which was nice. Then we had a little over 2 hours to kill waiting for our flight. Normally I'd scoff at going so
early, but there have been reports of airport issues due to staffing. Flight was smooth but neither of us slept. Pretty
standard for me but I worried how Cassie would fare. Our flight was followed by a train from the airport
to Roma Termini, where we got on another train to Florence (or Firenze as the Italians call it). Our hotel was
walking distance from the train station, so everything was fairly easy.

Once we were checked in, we rallied to stay awake, walked around, and finally settled at a little casual restaurant for
done sandwiches and caffeine. I think I got hustled into buying a ridiculously large latte, but I enjoyed it anyway.

We walked to see a statue of Perseus and Medusa that I was psyched to see, plus a bunch more walking and general sight seeing.

We ended up napping for a couple hours, then rallied again for dinner in view of the Tuscan sunset.

Florence is a lovely town.
I could definitely live here, assuming I could get out of the crowds.
All in all a great first day in Europe.
