* 0600 - woke up. Browsed Reddit a bit before getting up. Vibe on the internet is pretty grim. Seems like dystopia is on the menu boys
* 0700 - finally got up and around for the day. Cleaned up the kitchen a bit to mop up some of the mess from making pizza last night
* 0800 - hit the road, initially decided I'd walk to Dunkin Donuts for some coffee and a donut. The weather is amazing and enough to help me
forget what the world is up to. Thought about a Tao te Ching quote - something like "know that laws are provincial." Regardless of what the US
government is doing, there are good people out there. While the US is taking steps backwards, other countries are getting more civil. Nature
doesn't care about man's law. On my walk I decided to pull an audible and go back to The Curve (diner) for a greasy spoon style breakfast.
* 0900 - walked back home. A two mile walk roundtrip, which isn't enough to offset the steak and eggs I had for breakfast, but enough 
activity that it felt good to do it
* 0930 - shaved
* 1000 - read my book
* 1030 - played video games. Was going to play basketball, but it was still windy, and was getting closer to lunch. Decided to just double
down on video games and play basketball in the afternoon
* 1200 - light lunch of a side-size portion of gnocchi. Was still full from my big breakfast
* 1300 - headed out to Table Wine to pick up our bottle-of-the-month and a couple extra bottles of wine
* 1330 - played video games while Cassie opened up some packages she had delivered
* 1400 - went to the park to read
