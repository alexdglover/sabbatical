Little to report today. Spent the whole day packing suitcases and doing other last minute trip preparations.
Played a lot of video games in between activities. It was rainy all day, so it didn't feel like a wasted day by any
means.

I double checked my SIM card situation only to realize that I needed to activate it while I still had internet access.
Had I waited until I arrived in Italy like I originally planned, it might have been a real problem.

Today ends Phase 1 of my sabbatical. Phase 2 will be my trip to Italy, followed by the last 10 or so days of my
sabbatical (Phase 3).
