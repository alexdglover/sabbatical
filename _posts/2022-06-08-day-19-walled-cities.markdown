Day 19 had a tough start. Cassie's eye got real swollen over night from what we assumed was an allergic reaction to something. It was almost swollen shut. She handled it well
and wasn't in a lot of pain, but no one wants to walk around with a fat eye. We decided we'd go into one of the nearby towns to find a pharmacy. This actually worked out well
A because one of the closest towns is a beautiful walled city called San Gimignano. Parking in the town was a challenge, but once we ditched the car it was great. You could really
feel the age of the town, I felt I got a sense of how many generations lived, worked, married, had kids, etc in the same place I was strolling around. It wasn't ornate like buildings
we saw in Florence but it had a good neighborhood vibe to it. To be clear it was packed with tourists, and I don't know how many people are truly locals, but you could imagine what it
was like to live there in the past.

We hit the pharmacy first, and the pharmacist was a life saver. She spoke English, understood the problem, and hooked us up with some topical medicine specifically safe for use around
the eye. It may seem like a small thing but we went from worried and short on ideas to feeling well taken care of.

We did some more wandering through the city and stumbled on a little restaurant off the beaten path. They had a Michelin sign on their door but we didn't think much of it. Cassie
was drawn in by a gorgonzola ravioli with pear sauce dish on the menu. I'm so glad she was - I ended up having the best lasagna I've ever had, by a long shot. This was life changing
pasta. I'll update this post with the name of the restaurant.
