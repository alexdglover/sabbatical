Day 6 was productive, but a lot of it was shopping/returns. Used the quiet moments to do more reflecting on
my recent thoughts on meditation. 

* 0730 - walked a mile, got a latte
* 0900 - started errands. Dropped off the Mazda to get cleaned, returns, post office.
Got some new shoes to replace my 3 year old daily drivers
* 1200 - lunch with Cassie at Ancho y Agave
* 1330 - got home from errands. went for a walk through the neighborhood, walked a mile
* 1630 - Spanish tutoring lesson
    * Lesson went well. Tutor was speaking Spanish almost the entire lesson, was a good challenge for me and was
great to practice listening comprehension. Was able to converse about weekend plans and the nuance differences between
Spanish dialects. Looking forward to my next lesson
* 1730 - showered, played video games
* 1830 - had a Spartan dinner of ramen
* 1930 - watched TV with Cassie
* 2200 - fell asleep
