We slept in a bit and had an hour drive to the boat rental place, so first order of business was getting ready for the day (sunscreen and whatnot)
and getting to Port Andratx (pronounced andratch). We parked and found our way to the boats without much trouble. We had a boat reserved, and had a funny
conversation with one of the proprietors. This dude claimed there were no reservations today, but I still had the email exchange on my phone. Didn't seem to
matter in the end, there were plenty of boats available. I was fully prepared to explain the situation and finally use my mediocre Spanish skills, but it turned
out this dude was German. Spoke even less Spanish than I did, but decent English. It gets even weirder - Cassie talked to this guy and found out that this Mallorca
in general, and Playa de Palma in particular, is really popular with Germans. More on this later 

After some paperwork and moving my car to longer term parking, we were off. The boat was a slow 15hp cruiser, but it was comfortable and had a covered top to give
us some protection from the sun. The temperature was supposed to be in
the 90s but it felt very comfortable, especially once the boat was putting along. We had an anchor and some snorkeling equipment but we ended up having fun just
driving around and seeing the bays.

At one point Cassie took the wheel so I could take a leak off the side of the boat (apologies to any readers, people in Mallorca, and the Atlantic ocean) and
got confused about how to steer, so we ended up doing donuts as I peed off the boat. We had a big laugh.

We ate some leftover pizza on the boat before returning it. By the time we got back we were feeling a little rough - we both had sore throats, minor headaches.
Our first thought is that these were the first symptoms of COVID. We took a test at the hotel and it came back negative. We still wanted to be good citizens so
we discussed how we should quarantine, if we needed to change our flights, etc. We decided that we probably had a cold or something other than COVID, but that we
should stick to open air activities and avoid crowds just in case.

COVID or not, we were pretty tired and not feeling great. So the afternoon was mostly spent sleeping and watching Netflix. I felt a little silly watching TV instead
of writing, meditating, or doing something else 'productive.' But fuck that. I felt sick, and constant productivity is a bullshit cultural concept that we created.
I watched a bunch of really good episodes of Love, Death and, Robots. And I wasn't going anywhere when Cassie was sleeping anyway.

That night we had a dinner reservation at another Italian joint in the same general area as the night before, but further from the hotel. On our walk to the restaurant,
it dawned on me. This whole area is not only popular with Germans, it basically _is_ German. All the clubs were playing German music, the businesses and signage were
mostly in German, even the Italian restaurant menu was in German. The vast, vast majority of patrons were German. Unprompted, employees would assume you spoke German.
I wanted to practice my Spanish and found the one part of Spain that doesn't fucking speak it! I wasn't mad, the absurdity of it all left me laughing. Who would have guessed.

The days of eating too richly caught up to me and I finally wised up and got a salad for dinner.

The hotel rooftop bar was hosting a reggae band, so we finished up the day with a couple drinks. There were a few folks coughing and sneezing, so we switched chairs a
few times to maintain our distance. We crashed around 2300.
