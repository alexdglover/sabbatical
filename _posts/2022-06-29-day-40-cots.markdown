* 0700 - slept in
* 0900 - had breakfast. Cassie took the day off so we could hang out, so we spent a few minutes talking about what we wanted
to do with our day. We decided to walk to the zoo. Shortly after we realized we forgot that we also needed to take my car in
for detailing. 
* 0930 - dropped the car off for detailing, _tried_ to go to the zoo. Even right at 10, when the zoo opened, place was packed.
No parking. So we decided to bail. Ended up going home and decided to re-jig our day. We decided we'd camp out at home for a bit,
grab an early lunch, then get a boat first thing in the afternoon
* 1130 - drove out to the Edgewater Hotel, which has a casual restaurant attached. Had a quick lunch
* 1200 - got sun screen on, grabbed our gear, and headed to Brittingham to rent a paddle boat. Boated and swam around for about
2 hours. 
* 1500 - drove up to the capital square to put down our blanket and chair for Concerts on the Square. COTS is one of those
summer activities where you drink and eat tasty snacks, and the music is a backdrop (at least for people like me).
* 1600 - went and picked up my car from the detailing place. Shiny!
* 1700 - did a couple quick chores and played some video games to pass the time
* 1800 - made caprese sandwiches for dinner (for COTS)
* 1845 - walked up to the capital square for COTS
