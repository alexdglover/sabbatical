Today is day 30 of my 45 day sabbatical. The pessimist or worrier part of me recognizes that my time is 2/3 over. But I still have 15 days to do whatever I want or need.
For the rest of my vacation I'll just be relaxing, but part of my mind is already thinking about how to squeeze the most value from the last 2 weeks at home. Step 1 - stop
thinking about what I'm doing next, focus on what I'm doing now.

Some things I've thought about that I want to get on paper.
* I'm glad I took advantage of the sabbatical. Life is short. I've spent a lot of time thinking about retirement, but I'm assuming I'll spend
the rest of my life working. This is probably a unique opportunity, like having a summer off on a grander scale
* I think there is a general pattern of issues/solutions related to how different the human mind and body is wired, vs what we are expected to do in modern human culture.
There is the age old conflict of tempering desires - balancing the desire to eat with the aversion of being sickly full, for example. Then there are modern conflicts -
wanting to use our instincts and bodies, but instead doing very cerebral work sitting in an office. It's important to balance these things. We can tolerate a great amount
of modern life at a time, but most people need a more primitive outlet to balance things. I think this is why sports, hunting, competing, etc are so popular. It uses those
parts of our brain we often don't use in daily life. Without these outlets, we start to get snippy, get easily frustrated, and are generally irritable. We see the same behavior
in dogs. Find a dog that goes on two walks a day, and try to keep it inside for 24 hours. Observe the dog. Think how the behavior mirrors your own, or the behavior
of others when they are denied these outlets of primitive energy.
  * Tangent - part of my anxiety is cabin fever. Work might be part of it, but quarantining for COVID and being stuck indoors in the Wisconsin winters is an equally significant
factor. One of my goals should be to find outlets, activities, meditations that address this need
  * Tangent 2 - I'm wondering if the Rinzai Zen focus on mind-body exercises is just a broader application. If so, it begs the question, how was ancient Chinese life so problematic
that one needed to seek out these kinds of exercises? Maybe the farmers and laborers were in tune with the flow of the universe, but merchants, bureaucrats, etc face similar issues as
modern people
* The desire for purpose, the desire to understand the meaning of life is no different than the earthly desires. To yearn for purpose will leave you exhausted and empty. One must
instead live in tune with one's values as best we can. To have a purpose or meaning is a gift, but not a requirement for a good life. There is a quote from Seneca about living like a
guest at a party. If a tray of food is offered to you, by all means indulge. But don't push your way past guests to get to the trays. Be patient. Don't create problems by struggling
against the situation. But enjoy what you can
