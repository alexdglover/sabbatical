Day 3 has been fun and very active. Not sure how many miles I've walkeed today, but definitely getting a lot of exercise. Still sore from
the caulking I decided to do on day 1 but powering through. This was my first "real" sabbatical day, since I would have had the weekend
days off either way. 

* 0730 - walked 18 minutes to The Curve diner. Had a nice greasy spoon breakfast of eggs, hash browns, toast, and coffee. Walked back home.
Saw lots of geese and even some goslings. I swear I'm not trying for some weird bird theme for this sabbatical

* 0900 - free initial Spanish lesson via LanguageConvo.com. Struggled, but the instructor seemed
friendly so I signed up for a real, one hour lesson for tomorrow
* 0930 - did some online Spanish practice lessons
* 1000 - scheduled car detailing, talked to Cassie for awhile
* 1030 - walked to Brittingham park to shoot hoops
    * Going to the park was excellent. Had a pleasant walk to the park and the courts were
initially empty. Had the whole park to myself. The view beyond the hoop is pretty great, check out the picture below.
If you look closely, you'll see I wedged my ball against the rim at one point. I laughed rather than raged, which made me feel good. Made
me feel like I wasn't taking anything too seriously. Managed to knock it loose by throwing my water bottle at it. One of the local F-16
Falcons from the Air National Guard did a low and slow flyover, which felt like a private air show. I'm very mediocre at basketball
but managed to hit 5 free throws in a row which is pretty good for me. Talked to some randos in the park, including a vagrant rambling about
how California took down the basketball hoops after COVID hit.

* 1230 - lunch with Cassie
* 1300 - walked to bike shop, about a mile round trip
* 1400 - rented a paddle boat, the kind you _pedal_ (stupid name). Surprised at how smooth the boat
was, able to cruise at a pretty good clip without a lot of effort. Planning on renting one again soon, but this time bringing a cooler of
drinks and snacks

* 1530 - took a break. Cold coffee at home, videogames, and editing this post
* 1700 - did yoga, showered
* 1800 - made salad for dinner
* 1900 - streamed some movies with Cassie (finished "Can't Buy Me Love" and started "Guess Who"). Played some card games. Started to fall
asleep around 2200
