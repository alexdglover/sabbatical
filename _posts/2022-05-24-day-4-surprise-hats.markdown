Day 4 has been another day primarily indoors. Too cold for boating or basketball sadly. 


* 0730 - had to move the cars out of the garage for garage cleaning day. Used it as an excuse to drive out to a coffee shop where I could
loiter and let my mind wander a bit. Drove out to [Indie Coffee](http://indiecoffee.net/index.html) for a couple cups of coffee. Listened
to part of a Ten Percent Happier podcast but switched to music after awhile. Did some reflecting and writing. 
* 0900 - came home, moved Cassie's car to comply with nonsensical parking laws. Did some Duolingo and online Spanish lessons in preparation
for my tutoring session
* 1000 - Spanish tutoring with Ivan
* 1100 - moved the cars back into the garage
* 1130 - lunch with Cassie. Scrambled some eggs for a pair of very respectable egg sandwiches
* 1200 - walked to Capitol Centre (grocery store) because Cassie needed a few legitimate items, plus I wanted to buy the ingredients for
making "dirt" (Oreos, chocolage pudding mix, and gummy worms)
* 1300 - responded to a couple GitHub issues on my personal projects, played videogames
* 1400 - did some brief research on sim cards for Europe and replacement toner for the printer. Did a 20 minute yoga session with Cassie
* 1530 - had some tea
* 1600 - decided to watch a movie
* 1630 - Cassie came home, and it turns out my new hats had arrived a day early! One of them was a flat bill hat that didn't work out, but
one of them turned out perfect

* 1700 - chatted with Cassie, took a shower
* 1800 - started cooking dinner - buffalo tofu wrap, with fried tofu. A complicated enough recipe that it feels like it will be a minor
accomplishment
* 1900 - finally ate dinner. Turned out pretty tastey. Rounded the meal out with two off-brand Oreos and some dish washing
* 1930 - finished this blog post



Thoughts/impressions from today:
* I responded to a few GitHub issues on some of my personal projects. Just saw them in my email, knocked out a couple merges and comments
while waiting for something else. Doing a little computer work didn't bother me. Then my Jekyll site was behaving oddly, not building this
post for some reason. Debugged for 5 minutes only for it to randomly start working. So a reminder of how it feels being productive
on a computer and of being frustrated by a computer, in small doses
* Spanish tutoring is going slow, feeling impatient. Noting it in case frustration/impatience is a pattern
* I was really psyched about my new hat! I am going to try reflecting back on the unboxing to squeeze all of the hedonic joy out of it
* I'm enjoying writing these posts. Thinking about continuing a journal outside of these sabbatical posts when its over
* The pain in my chest I associate with anxiety still persists. Going to give it a few more days, see if I have other signs of being less
anxious. Hypothesis is that the pain in my chest is a constant. Hopefully I'm wrong and some more unemployed time will further reduce
anxiety and the pain goes away
* My activity level seems heavily dependent on good weather
