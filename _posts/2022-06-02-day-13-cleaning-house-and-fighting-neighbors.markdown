Day 13 was productive - I got lots of cleaning done and really put some miles on my new bike. I'm feeling sore from all of the bike
riding, basketball, and kayaking, but it feels good to be a little sore.

* 0730 - made coffee at home, ate another muffin for breakfast
* 0800 - played video games
* 0900 - started cleaning up the house
* 1145 - cooked omelettes and breakfast potatoes for lunch
* 1245 - drove Cassie to work
* 1300 - took my bike up to the capital, down state street, then doubled back a bit to get on the bike path.
Took the bike path to a coffee shop a mile or two away. Had a cold coffee and chatted up some strangers. Biked back home
* 1500 - played video games
* 1545 - finished cleaning the house. Even did some of the chores Cassie was supposed to do, because she seemed stressed about all the
things she had on her to-do list
* 1700 - showered
* 1800 - ate dinner with Cassie
* 1830 - meeting with my condo neighbors. I was a little harsh with some of my neighbors, said one of their suggestions was "categorically
a bad idea."  This is something I struggle with at work too. Disappointing, but interesting to learn that this problem isn't unique to work.
Not sure if this means I'm a bit of an asshole everywhere, or that I should live and work with less group interaction
* 1930 - had some wine and beer with neighbors
* 2100 - watched TV with Cassie then went to bed at 2300
