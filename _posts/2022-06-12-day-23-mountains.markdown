My sabbatical is now more than half over!

Finally woke up at what I'd consider a normal hour (about 0600). Generally felt good, except my back is hurting much
worse today. It was feeling great after a long day in a warm car with a decent seat, not sure what made it worse overnight.
I think it's just a spasm, as it actually feels better if I run a bit and seems to bear weight just fine. Planning on continuing
with our original plan of hiking today. Time to load up on Tylenol and cross my fingers.

I used my extra time this morning to catch up on writing blog posts. It was a good reminder of how quickly I forget things,
and all the benefits I get from writing. 

Got small breakfast at hotel. Took assortment of trains and cable cars to top of the mountain. Saw lots of mountains and waterfalls, could see all the way to Bern.
Had lunch, met some nice Americans. Started the long trek back from the mountain top. Hiked down part of the mountain, about 2 miles.
Even more trains and cable cars. Walked through Lauterbrunnen and saw a very picturesque church.

Picked up some supplies and beers, then made it back to the hotel. Cleaned up, took an accidental nap. Walked to a nearby restaurant and had minestrone
and pizza for dinner. Predicted a storm based on a squall line wind.

Returned to hotel and practiced Spanish for awhile. Getting really good even without my tutor!

All of the crowds reaffirmed my dislike of crowds and people when acting like herd animals. That's our nature though, I shouldn't be surprised or angry.
