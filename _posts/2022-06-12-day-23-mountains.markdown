My sabbatical is now more than half over!

Finally woke up at what I'd consider a normal hour (about 0600). Generally felt good, except my back is hurting much
worse today. It was feeling great after a long day in a warm car with a decent seat, not sure what made it worse overnight.
I think it's just a spasm, as it actually feels better if I run a bit and seems to bear weight just fine. Planning on continuing
with our original plan of hiking today. Time to load up on Tylenol and cross my fingers.

I used my extra time this morning to catch up on writing blog posts. It was a good reminder of how quickly I forget things,
and all the benefits I get from writing. 

To start the day, we got a light breakfast at the hotel. From there, we decided to start the trek up to Schlithorn, a mountain
top with views of all the surrounding mountains, and a rotating restaurant where you can view it all. Cheesy right? It gets better -
this place was used in one of the older James Bond movies, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." It took two trains and three cable cars to
get there, which was (relatively) expensive, crowded, and time consuming. Once we got up there, it was really cool and easy to overlook the
cheesy bits. We saw lots of mountains and waterfalls, and could see all the way to Bern. We had lunch at the revolving restaurant and met
some nice Americans. Restaurant was pretty good for a tourist trap, and was a much more relaxed place to view all the surrounding mountains.
After lunch, we started the long trek back from the mountain top. We took two cable cars down most of the way, then hiked down part of the
mountain, about 2 miles. Followed by 2 more cable cars. Taking cable cars beats the hell out of climbing all of these mountains in terms of
speed and ease, but man, they are crowded and you have to take a bunch to get places.


Once we were at the bottom of the valley, we walked through Lauterbrunnen and saw a very picturesque church.

At this point I was pretty tapped. I was dressed for the cold, and it was hot most of the day. Crowds drained my patience. We took the
Lauterbrunnen train to Wengen, picked-up up some supplies and beers, then made it back to the hotel. Cleaned up, took an accidental nap
for about an hour. We walked to a nearby restaurant and had minestrone and pizza for dinner. I predicted a storm based on a [squall line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall_line)
wind which is always satisfying. The storm was over before we even finished dinner.

Returned to hotel and practiced Spanish for awhile. Getting really good even without my tutor!
