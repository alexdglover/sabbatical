Woke up and got packed again. In the morning, Cassie and I did some mediocre watercolor painting of the views from
our hotel balcony. It's silly, neither of us are artists, but I do think it's a good way to soak in the views without
just standing there like an idiot, or buying coffee/meals as an excuse to sit and enjoy the views. We haven't remembered
the paints until today, so this is our first session. Hopefully we'll have time and remember to do more on our trip.

We stopped for free breakfast at the hotel before checking out and starting the drive to Switzerland. My back was still hurting
and honestly making me crabby (look, I'm more self aware!) so I popped a few Tylenol as we left. Getting out of the Lake Garda
region was easy - it was a Saturday, so all of the locals were driving _into_ the area, we were the only car leaving. We stopped to
get some diesel after awhile. Me and another European (couldn't tell if he was German, Swiss, or Austrian) both struggled for a bit
figuring out how to pay for gas. I ended up paying cash, as the machine didn't seem to like any of my cards. Gas was about €2/L, but
I had no idea how many liters the Mini could hold. I bought 10 L, checked the gas tank and decided to buy 5 more. At this point a
gas station attendant showed up and tried to help me. I didn't need any help, but it was a reminder of how many Europeans speak an
impressive amount of English, and how friendly the average person is (outside of touristy areas).

Throughout our drive, tolls were a theme. We arrived at our first toll booth worrying that we might not have exact change, only to
find that this first toll booth just issued a ticket to mark your origin. We eventually paid that toll without issue, and surrendered
our origin ticket. Then we hit another similar looking tollbooth, and panicked. We don't have a ticket this time, did we screw something up?
We debated a last second exit ramp, debated which lane we needed to go to so we could explain our situation. I wasn't worried that
we'd be in any trouble, but my greatest fear was jamming up a tollbooth lane with a 100 cars behind me. And this road was _busy_.
When we got to the booth there was no problem at all, they just wanted €2.80. No ticket needed, no muss, no fuss. I had worked up
so much anxiety I managed to drop the money when I tried to pay the lady who worked the tollbooth. I hopped out quickly to grab the bill I
dropped, we all had a laugh, and we kept driving.

So morale of the story, don't sweat anything, it's probably going to be fine.

Driving through the rest of Italy was easy. We got to see several other beautiful lakes (Lugano, Lucerne, Como) as we drove through.
When we got to the border with Switzerland, there was an easy place to pull off and buy a "vignette" which is some kind of toll sticker
you buy once and stick to your windshield. We picked up some snacks and coffee at the same place and life was good. On the road again...

After entering Switzerland, my European SIM card stopped working, and at one point we stopped the Map app to save power. So we no longer
had active navigation. Fortunately the rental had GPS in it, although we never quite trusted the routes it suggested since they were so
different from the phone GPS. Fortunately Cassie had taken some screenshots of the directions earlier and was able to navigate us without
the phone. The route through Switzerland was beautiful, taking us past the lakes, huge mountains, and bright green farmland. We were on big
roads and tiny country roads. We pulled over at a random spot and the views gave the Lake Garda a run for its money.

At the most rural portion of the route, the car alerted me that oil was low and needed to be topped up ASAP.
What a piece of shit - the car rental disappointments continue. We eventually got to a gas station about 20 minutes later. After some
rough translating of the cars owners manual (it was in Italian) and a little help from a Swiss dude who worked at the gas station, we got
some oil and refilled the tank. Sing it with me this time - "On the road again..."

The long drive ultimately took us to a train station that took us from the tiny town of Lauterbrunnen to the even tinier mountain side town
of Wengen, where our hotel is. We checked in and walked into town to find dinner.

I'm not really a foodie, but I tried some Swiss Rösti for the first time (sort of like hash browns) so I'm posting it. By the time we
finished dinner and got back to the hotel it was almost 2200 and still light out. We started planning the next day and finally crashed at
2300.
