Lazy day. Breakfast at the hotel, including some good American style coffee. I know European coffee, especially Italian, is supposed to be the shit.
But an espresso or latte just isn't the same as a full mug of drip coffee.

We had a slow start, since we had no concrete plans for the day. We looked into taking the ferries so we could see one of the neighboring cities and get
out on the lake, but the ferry schedule was... tough. It's a big lake, and the ferry routes don't always stop at each location, so taking a ferry was going
to leave us in one of these nearby cities for 3+ hours. We didn't think we'd enjoy just milling about for that long, so we eventually bailed on that idea.

We'd burned a couple hours trying to figure out activities for the day at this point, so we grabbed lunch
near our hotel and enjoyed the lake views for awhile. I think this was more relaxing than a ferry trip anyway so all's well that ends well.

After lunch, we decided to drive along the lake through multiple cities. Stopped in Campione to check out the beach briefly and dip our toes into the water.
Campione was an interesting small (very small) town shadowed by huge mountains, with a lot of kite surfers and wind surfers, and not a lot else.

Tunnels on the road around the lake were even more narrow and sketchy than the rural roads through Tuscany, but I'm getting a good feel for the Mini now.

After our drive we came back to the
hotel, put swimsuits on, and hung out by the lake. Had a nice gin and tonic to help with my back pain and started reading "Day by Day:
Armageddon," a book about surviving the zombie apocalypse. I don't think this book gets a lot of critical acclaim, but it's the perfect page turner for me.

We ended up eating dinner at the same place we had lunch earlier in the day. I really liked how casual and unassuming it was - dishes were simple, cheap, and
hit the spot without using a ton of grease or salt. Cassie thought I specifically wanted to eat there for some other reason, but I don't think she was upset
that we ate there. I managed to leave my water bottle there at lunch and my hoodie at dinner time, so this sabbatical has had no effect on my forgetfulness.

After dinner we walked the riverfront for awhile, appreciating the views and people watching. Before retiring to the hotel I got some gelato to finish off the day.
I was pretty full from dinner but I knew we were leaving Italy the next day. Can't visit Italy without getting some gelato.
