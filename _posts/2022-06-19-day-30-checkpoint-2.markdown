Today is day 30 of my 45 day sabbatical. The pessimist or worrier part of me recognizes that my time is 2/3 over. But I
still have 15 days to do whatever I want or need. For the rest of my vacation I'll just be relaxing, but part of my mind
is already thinking about how to squeeze the most value from the last 2 weeks at home. Step 1 - stop thinking about what
I'm doing next, focus on what I'm doing now.

Today was another pool day. Got a lot of sun which felt good, plus I did lots of reading, writing, and reflecting
(reflections below). Philosophizing aside, I started reading the second book in the Bosch series, which is starting off
real strong. It has been real hot in Mallorca, so we spent some time in the pool too. It was a real relaxing day at the
hotel. Ate lighter breakfast, and a light-ish salad for lunch.

Around 1600 we got cleaned up and drove into Palma, the biggest city on the island. We saw some great views of the
cathedral and even heard some special music being played for Sunday service.

We walked around the city a bit, I picked up some new cheap tshirts (I didn't pack enough or clean enough when I did
laundry), then walked some more. Cassie decided she didn't like the vibe as much as Valldemossa, so we went back to the
car and headed out. We walked through the town and ate at a restaurant we saw the day before. Turns out this little
unassuming restaurant in rural Mallorca was part of a five star hotel. Food was great, I had avocado toast and a
Heineken, followed by finishing off the rest of Cassie's pizza.

## Reflections

Some things I've thought about that I want to get on paper.
* I'm glad I took advantage of the sabbatical. Life is short. I've spent a lot of time thinking about retirement, but I'm
assuming I'll spend the rest of my life working. This is probably a unique opportunity, like having a summer off on a
grander scale
* I think there is a general pattern of issues/solutions related to how different the human mind and body is wired, vs
what we are expected to do in modern human culture. There is the age old conflict of tempering desires - balancing the
desire to eat with the aversion of being sickly full, for example. Then there are modern conflicts -
wanting to use our instincts and bodies, but instead doing very cerebral work sitting in an office. It's important to
balance these things. We can tolerate a great amount of "modern life" at a time, but most people need a more primitive
outlet to balance things. I think this is why sports, hunting, competing, etc are so popular. It uses those parts of our
brain we don't often use in an office job. Hell, even cleaning can feel like a welcome break from thinking at times.
Without these outlets, we start to get snippy, get easily frustrated, and are generally irritable. We see the same behavior
in dogs. Find a dog that goes on two walks a day, and try to keep it inside for 24 hours. Observe the dog. Think how the
behavior mirrors your own, or the behavior of others when they are denied these outlets of primitive energy.
  * Tangent - I theorize that part of my anxiety is cabin fever. Work might be part of it, but quarantining for COVID and
being stuck indoors in the Wisconsin winters is an equally significant factor. One of my goals should be to find outlets,
activities, meditations that address this need
  * Tangent 2 - I'm wondering if the Rinzai Zen focus on mind-body exercises is just a broader application of the need to
get back to less cerebral, more instinctive activities. If so, it begs the question, how was ancient Chinese life so
problematic that one needed to seek out these kinds of exercises? Maybe the farmers and laborers were in tune with the
flow of the universe, but merchants, bureaucrats, etc faced similar issues as modern people
* The desire for purpose, the desire to understand the meaning of life is no different than earthly desires. To yearn for
purpose will leave you exhausted and empty. Some people are lucky and have found purpose, or defined purpose for themself.
To have a purpose or meaning is a gift, but not a requirement for a good life. For the rest of us, we must
instead accept that either there is no purpose, that it's unknown to us, or that it is inherently _unknowable_, and live in
tune with our values as best we can. There is a quote from Seneca about living like a guest at a party. If a tray of food
is offered to you, by all means indulge. But don't push your way past guests to get to the trays. Be patient. Don't create
problems by struggling against the situation. But enjoy what you can, and appreciate it
* It's importance to balance self esteem/self worth with self improvement. If you only focus on improvement, you won't
recognize your worth. If you hold yourself in too high esteem, you'll lack the motivation to continue challenging yourself


### Zen, step by step

Either Zen teachings get murkier the more you progress, or I just can't remember shit well enough to piece it all together.
So let's try to break down a Zen practice into some short, basic steps/assertions. I'll add my own notes/tangents but try
to keep them clearly separated.
1. Your mind is filled with desires, which clouds the mind and causes unhappiness.
2. You can quiet your mind by focusing on something else.
  * There's good science (e.g. fMRI scans) to back this up
3. With a quiet mind, you see the bigger picture. You "see" yourself as being connected to everything else. This leads to
more compassion, because you don't think of yourself as being separate or independent from other beings.
  * This is exactly how I would describe my first experience taking psychedelic mushrooms. The implications are unclear -
are psychedelics a gateway to better understanding, or is drug induced euphoria a solution to personal desires, leaving you
open to more empathy? In other words, are drugs just a fast substitute to satisfying enough of your desires to achieve
brief clarity
4. One who has emptied their mind can act in perfect harmony with the universe. "You can't separate the dancer from the
dance." The performer is acting instinctively, and by doing so taps into some part of the mind or body that is more capable
than the conscious self. In the Tao te Jing this is referred to as [Wei Wu Wei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei)
, literally doing not doing. Athletes are very much aware of this phenomenon - they report slowing of perceived time,
tunnel vision, acting before their conscious mind is even aware of something. Malcolm Gladwell explains these kinds of
phenomena in his book Blink, explaining how humans can use a different part of our brain, not directly accessible to our
conscious self, to do amazing things. Whether you want to subscribe to the Eastern or Western explanations, there's
definitely some truth here. But there's a few problems:
  * Letting a different part of your brain drive may be a useful skill, an interesting neurological behavior, but it's not
the same thing as surrendering to the universe or Tao. We can point out which part of your brain is active at these times,
there's nothing magical about it. It's very real, physical, and if that part of your brain was damaged, you'd lose this
ability. So it must not be the universe or some greater force beyond our corporal selves. Anything that can be smashed
with a hammer is not magical.
  * Ignoring the implications of the physical nature, the function itself is not some godly altruism that we claim it is.
If we include all the aspects of how this part of the brain works, this includes racism and prejudice. So it's not a
silver bullet for how to think and act
  * Deferring to the unconscious self's intelligence or mind-body intelligence is only possible for those who have
cultivated those abilities. (There are some innate abilities all humans have, like flinching, but let's set those aside
for now.) So a Buddhist monk, no matter how enlightened, isn't suddenly going to be able to surrender to the body's wisdom
and bat a 0.500 in baseball for example. So surrending to some greater force isn't a catch-all solution for being awesome
at anything on an ad hoc basis. That's OK, I don't think anyone is claiming it works that way. The next question is, how
does one cultivate the skills, the innate ability to _live in tune with the Tao_, the universe, whatever? I suppose the
same way you get good at baseball, you play a shit load of baseball. So maybe it is possible to build some mind-body wisdom,
some innate wisdom on how to live, if you just practice how to live well a lot. Practicing things like detachment, letting
go, going with the flow, and introspecting. Maybe the super power, the specific skill or second nature we're supposed to be
cultivating is the ability to let go.
5. The truly enlightened have no sense of self, and recognize the sense of self as a delusion.
  * This is where I really struggle in Zen training. The one explanation I have is that our human brains have evolved to
value society, family. You might think you're selfish, but in a scenario where small personal sacrifice would greatly
benefit the many, most of us would prioritize others. So maybe, with a quiet and clear mind, the part of our brain that
prioritizes the greater good is more prominent. Additionally, the Tao te Jing often talks about the Great Mother.
Ignoring human mortality, each individual human is like a branch of one big tree. And in fact, all animals and plants
are part of that same tree. Going one step further, all life is really a chain reaction from inanimate materials, so all
life is connected to the initial meteorite or primordial soup, wherever life originated. The final step, as far as
science can show us, would be all material originating from the big bang. So I guess I do get it, even without mysticism,
we can see that everything is connected in a way, everything is one.


In moments of clarity like this, my next thought is how to apply these thoughts. How to live differently. But I don't see
how. In moments of peace I just want to meditate and rest forever. I must eat. I should probably help others. But if
there is no I, and the universe is also the source of hunger, the source of suffering, I'm not sure I can or even should
try to change anything. I can only think to fall back to surrendering.
