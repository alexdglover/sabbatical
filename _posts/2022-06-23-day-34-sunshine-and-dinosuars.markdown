In spite of going to bed at ~2000 the night before, I slept in until about 0800. I realized I had underestimated the jet
lag at this point.

Once I finally got up and around, I decided to go to the park to shoot hoops. I dropped Cassie off at work on the way,
then spend about 2 hours at the park. And I shot like shit. The. Entire. Time. My best run was 3 free throws in a row,
and I was probably shooting 10%. I mostly enjoyed my time outside and in the sun, but it was hard to shake some of the
frustration.

We ate the rest of the gazpacho for lunch, then Cassie had to go back to work. I decided I was going to go on an
extended bike ride for the afternoon, and pick up some afternoon coffee to help get back on GMT-5 time. I started my
ride around the capital and down State St, where I decided to get some iced coffee and people watch for awhile. The
area was busy with bikers, skateboarders, people walking, businesses playing music, people blaring music on their
phones. In spite of all the activity it was very relaxing. It was easy to zone out and not focus on any one thing
because there were so many distractions.

I decided I had loitered long enough, and got back on my bike. I weaved my way down by campus, as there's an easy
route to the bike path from there. Once on the bike path, I went a few miles to the west. On my way, I ran into some
kids running a lemonade stand. I'm a sucker for entrepeneur kids, and it was pretty hot, so I bought a couple
lemonades before resuming my ride. After another mile or so, I wanted to turn around, but didn't want to see the same
scenery of the bike path. So I hopped off on some random road, Sheldon St, and started biking back. I didn't look up
directions, I mostly just tried to head east until I saw some landmarks. I ended up further south than expected,
riding past the zoo and the Vilas neighborhood before riding up Park St back to the house.

I was pretty gross from biking and sitting in the sun all day, so I took a shower before helping with some of the
laundry Cassie had started.

Cassie and I had made plans to go see the new Jurassic Park and get dinner. We got some thin crust pizza at the
theater. Neither the movie nor the pizza were all that good, but I really enjoyed the "movie-going experience." It
was still light out when we left the movies around 2000, and still warm out too. Felt great, and automatically
triggered some summer nostalgia.

Crashed around 2200 after watching some TV at home with Cassie.
