Today is only July 3rd, but we treated it like the 4th of July since the weather is much better than what's forecasted
for the 4th. Lots of summer activities today.

* 0700 - slept in
* 0800 - cereal and coffee at home
* 0900 - played video games
* 1000 - read my book
* 1030 - rented a stand up paddleboard, paddled around the bay for an hour
* 1200 - quick lunch of PB&J and an orange
* 1330 - biked back to Brittingham Bay, rented a paddle boat. Broat some sodas, did some swimming, got lots of sun
* 1600 - went back home. Had a snack, played some video games. Cassie and I decided to go out later, since the fireworks
won't start until later in the night anyway
* 1900 - Cassie and I rode our bikes to Potbelly's to pick up some sandwiches and then took them to the Memorial Union. 
There was a decent band playing, lots of fireworks visible across the lake from all the neighboring cities and towns.
I drank almost an entire pitcher of Zombie Dust beer. We had a good time just hanging out together
* 2200 - Rode our bikes back home. Was a lot of fun riding around at night slightly inebriated. We stayed up for awhile hydrating
and 
* 2230 - crashed
