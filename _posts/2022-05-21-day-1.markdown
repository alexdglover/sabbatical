Day 1 of 45 is nearly over. Had a very positive day - reasonably productive, **very** relaxed. The weather was a little cold and windy,
which limited the possibilities a bit. Here's a quick recap of what I did today:

* 0700 - meditated, listened to Ten Percent Better podcast
* 0800 - played Apex Legends (videogames), did some pushups. Emptied the dishwasher
* 0900 - braved the cold, took a 30 minute walk, got coffee at Cafe Social (spent \<$4)
* 1000 - finished house caulking project. Took about 2.5 hours, very satisfying work. Listened to podcasts and music while I worked, felt
productive, got moving. Worked up a sweat.
* 1230 - ate vegetarian "chicken" nuggets and french fries for lunch with cassie, delicious meal. You're wrong if you don't like chicken
nuggets
* 1330 - drove to campus, took another walk with Cassie. Walked for about 45 minutes, saw a pair of big cranes or herons up close, probably
got within 6 feet of these birds. Also got some Starbucks refreshers on the way back. Spent ~$8
* 1430 - sat outside with refreshers. Briefly used my phone to look up a detailing service and check a local bike store. Also scheduled my
first Spanish lesson for Monday
* 1530 - drove out to Papa Murphy's to pick up some take and bake pizza. ~$27
* 1600 - cleaned the wiper blades,  took some junk out of the trunk on the Mazda3
* 1700 - played video games then showered
* 1800 - writing this blog post while pizza cooks


I still have a solid 3 hours left in the day, but I'm planning on spending most of that eating dinner and relaxing with some TV. 

Thoughts/impressions from today:
* I enjoyed working on random domestic tasks. Specifically enjoyed the caulking/insulating work and cleaning the car. I appreciated the
exercise and variety. Feel like I could enjoy this kind of work a lot, but we'll see how sore I am tomorrow. Might change my mind
* I feel a little bit like the typical retiree, who initially fills their time with housework, only to have issues with fulfillment once
there's no more housework to be done. Will reflect more on this later
* Journaling about my day feels like it's good for my memory, my skill of recollection. But alarmed I can't perfectly recall even all of
today
* Filling a day was easy, but still feels like a generous amount of time to work with. Thinking about how my first day is almost over makes
45 days seem short. I'm 2.2% done with my sabbatical already. Debating on whether I should try to avoid counting days to better
appreciate my time
* I spent ~2 hours playing video games. Seems luxurious, but may be not the best use of time. Going to write this off as a side effect of
cooler weather
* I spent ~$40 dollars, and made plans to spend more on detailing
