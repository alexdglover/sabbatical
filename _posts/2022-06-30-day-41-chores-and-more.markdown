* 0700 - got up, floundered for awhile. Browsing on my phone and debating some different activities I could do for the day.
Was thinking about the gun range, or a flying lesson, or maybe skydiving. Forecast was too windy for skydiving - that's how
I lost my deposit the last two times I tried to go. Gun range seemed pricey, so I killed off that idea.
* 0800 - walked to a nearby coffee shop to grab some plain black coffee. Sat in the sun for awhile, wrote down some things
I wanted to do, tried to get _organizized_. Was in such a good mood that I took a long walk home
* 0930 - got home, talked to Cassie for a bit. 
* 1200 - simple lunch at home. Had 2 PB&J sandwiches
* 1300 - went for a long walk around the neighborhood, probably ~1 mile
* 1330 - drove to the grocery store to pick up some items for making pizza. Picked up a green pepper, a block of provolone
cheese, and an orange (just for snacking, not for the pizza)
* 1400 - completed some health/wellness work as part of our health insurance. I was going through the motions because there
is a $150 gift card reward if you complete it, but I actually really enjoyed the podcasts I listened to. There was a podcast
about purpose, and how you can formulaically create a purpose roadmap/statement for yourself. I captured it in my private
journal for future reference and use going forward
* 1500 - took care of a bunch of minor tasks that were building up. Emailed a contractor about some repairs to our condo,
responded to some emails, cleaned out my car, and set up my new phone mount for my car
* 1600 - did yoga and some light exercise
* 1700 - showered
* 1730 - started making pizza! This was the big conclusion to all the work I had done so far
* 1830 - ate the pizza!
* 1900 - read my book and played rumikub outside on the patio. Made some updates to this blog post
* 2100 - watched Stranger Things
