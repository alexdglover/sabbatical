We woke up a little late, still adjusting to local time. We ventured out to get coffee and some light breakfast before
we had to go get our rental car and start the trek to our next hotel in Tuscany. Light breakfast in this case meant "not paninis" because
paninis are the only non-sit-down food available in the tourist areas and we ate them for the last few meals. I got a cappuccino first,
then we settled on a place with Italian donuts, waffles, and gelato. We ate it on the streets as we watched the crowds march by.

We grabbed our bags from the hotel, requested a taxi, and were flying through Florence streets by 1400. The car rental area seemed clean
and modern. After several disappointments, we ultimately left the lot with a Mini Cooper instead of a BMW or Mercedes, and paid more for
insurance than planned. I reminded myself that this is how every car rental experience goes and decided to move on with life.

All my complaining aside, it's a fast little two door car, and it was a unique experience because I'd never buy a Mini Cooper.

Driving on the highways in Italy was easy and similar to driving in the US. Countryside driving was much more harrowing - roads are barely
wide enough for two cars, limited visibility from all the hills and curves, and there will randomly be a pedoni (pedestrian). All this at about
90 km/h. The country driving was fun most of the time, but punctuated with heart attacks.

About an hour later we arrived at our next hotel in the Tuscan countryside, and this place is beautiful. The rolling hills are so picturesque
that they look fake. The weather was amazing, and we spent some time just walking the property and sitting out in the sun.

We had dinner at the hotel that night, including some great pasta, tuna steak, and a bottle of local wine. Tuscany really lives up to the hype.
