Day 11 was very productive. Still played about an hour's worth of video games, but was active almost all day otherwise. Also got lots of
chores and errands done which felt productive. Storms were predicted for the afternoon, but I ultimately decided to ignore the weatherman
and decide it wasn't going to storm today. 

* 0730 - walked to get coffee. Really enjoyed the weather on the walk to and from the coffee shop. Probably walked a half mile
* 0830 - played video games
* 0930 - left for a doctor appointment
* 1100 - ran some errands at Hy-Vee and took Cassie to Michael's
* 1200 - picked up Taco Bell for lunch and ate it at home. Fue fantastico!
* 1300 - went for a long walk through Brittingham Park. Walked about 2 miles
* 1500 - drove back to Brittingham to shoot some hoops while Cassie went to a hair appointment. Shot pretty well, but then the wind got
strong and I bailed
* 1530 - started assembling the bike Cassie bought. Was nice working with my hands and basic tools

* 1630 - went to Budget Bicycle Center to find a bike for myself. They had lots of used bikes, including this interesting "automatic three
gear" bike that shifted automatically for you. Cheapest bike in there was the automatic at $399, so I decided to shop around a bit more
before pulling the trigger
* 1730 - showered
* 1800 - did some writing while waiting for Cassie
* 1900 - made chocolate chip pancakes and fruit smoothies for dinner
* 2000 - writing this blog post!

I came across the paper calendar I printed specifically for my sabbatical and noticed I'm already into week 2, so I'm at least 1/6 or ~16%
done already. I think I should write a recap soon, maybe after 1/3 of the sabbatical is over, to reflect on what I've done so far. Review
my goals for the sabbatical, update my progress.

I've reiterated to myself that I will continue writing after the sabbatical is over. Writing has been helpful in multiple
ways, much more effective than I would have predicted. I have had multiple unexpected insights.
