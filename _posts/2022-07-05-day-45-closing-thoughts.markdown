Today is the last day of my sabbatical. I have a very decent hangover from drinking a pitcher of beer by myself (mostly). Ending the sabbatical
with a hangover feels right. The weather is cloudy, cool, with rain forecasted for most of the day. The plan is to recover, reflect, and watch
Independence Day.

## Closing thoughts

Looking back on the last 45 days, with no judgement, with objective observation, I can say a few things. Using time well is *almost* as important
as having free time. Even with no job, there were lots of cases where I didn't have time to do something. Too close to another item in my itinerary,
unable to schedule because I was waiting on someone else's schedule, people weren't available, businesses/parks weren't open yet, inclement weather.

This is part of the reason why I played video games so often. It's easy to do with no notice or planning, can be played for anywhere between 5 and
500 minutes, and has so few requirements/dependencies (like weather or other people). I think video games are like snacks - easy to consume, but
that's specifically why you need to watch your consumption. It's easier to eat a handful of chips than a cutting up a healthy orange. We just need
to make the effort to have the orange some times.







### Outcomes

#### Hypothesis 1 - retired life is great

I was pretty confident in this hypothesis, and for all intents and purposes retired life is amazing. But I did learn a few things.
Not working doesn't mean you're free from, or immune to, interpersonal conflict. You are still subject to negative emotions like
frustration, anxiety, and sadness. It still takes effort and planning to connect with family and friends, even if you're schedule is
wide open. Not working isn't a silver bullet for everything. Hell it's not a silver bullet for _anything_.

For me, I think retired life is great because
* You get 40+ hours per week to do whatever you want. Out of ~100 walking hours, that's substantial. Time to do new things, or just do
_more_ of the things you already do
* You introduce slack into your schedule. Even on my more structured days, there was some unallocated time. I think this slack was
extremely valuable in reducing stress, by creating a sense of time affluence
* It removes some of the common stressors of work (timelines/due dates, interpersonal conflict)


#### Hypothesis 2 - my anxiety is strictly work related

Mixed results here. Work is definitely a major contributor to my anxiety. However I wasn't 100% anxiety free while on sabbatical either.
I do think the sabbatical acted as a good reset - I scored much better on a recent anxiety test, and I have more clarity about the
role of my job in my life. Time will tell if I can maintain my new perspective, or if I'll simply fall back to old patterns.

#### Get fit

Calling this one a success. I exercised in some fashion nearly every day, sometimes for hours. I'm sure I look the same, but I've definitely
built some muscle. I should be doing more strenuous cardio but this is still progress.

#### Hablo Espanol

I slipped on this goal after the first third of my time. I wasn't doing any lessons while I was traveling (which was the plan) but I didn't
hit the ground running when I got back. Scheduling the lesson seemed like a conflict with other stuff I wanted to do, and I kept pushing it
off. My goal was 5 hours of tutoring, of which I completed 2.5. That's OK - I think being bilingual will always be out of reach for me, but I'm
going to finish the remaining 2.5 hours on principal.

#### Disconnect

Mostly successful here. I rarely used a computer for anything. I did succumb to scrolling through reddit or reading articles suggested my Google
a few times. But overall I really enjoyed flushing my brain of computer problems and not getting sucked into the internet content machine. I
plan to keep scrolling out of my life, try to replace it with journaling on my phone or pushups. If I've got time to scroll, it means I've got
time to be doing something more valuable to me.
