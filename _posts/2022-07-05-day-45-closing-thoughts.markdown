Today is the last day of my sabbatical. I have a very decent hangover from drinking a pitcher of beer by myself (mostly). Ending the sabbatical
with a hangover feels right. The weather is cloudy, cool, with rain forecasted for most of the day. The plan is to recover, reflect, and watch
Independence Day.

## Time journal

* 0845 - finally woke up from my hungover, fitful sleep. Was craving greasy breakfast, best I could do at home was some buttered toast
and some pour-over coffee
* 1000 - did some reading on our patio. Finished "The Common Good" by Robert Reich. Kind of a tough read because he does such a good job
explaining the importance of the common good, and how American culture has fucked it up pretty nicely over the last 50 years, but then
his suggestions for how to improve it are mostly for politicians, CEOs, etc. Not a lot of specific suggestions for the little guy. Regardless,
I've decided I'm going to try to find little ways to improve the common good, and maybe instill the same interest in others
* 1200 - went out for lunch at Cafe Hollander. Big wait, so we didn't eat until about 1300
* 1430 - started Independence Day
* 1600 - intermission while Cassie talked to her family. I did some writing. Then watched another segment of Independence Day
* 1700 - called my Mom and chatted for about an hour
* 1830 - cooked some vegetarian hot dogs, cut up some watermelon for dinner
* 1900 - went for a short walk, about a mile
* 1930 - watched the rest of Independence Day, did some more writing
* 2100 - watched the fireworks and a storm roll in from our rooftop. This picture doesn't do it justice, but the sky was high contrast
at dusk, a real show of yellows, reds, and pockets of blue between the clouds.

* 2130 - worked on this post
* 2200 - watched a show with Cassie before crashing at 2230

## Closing thoughts

I'm trying to look back on the last 45 days, with no judgement, with objective observation. Using time well is *almost* as important
as having free time. Even with no job, there were lots of cases where I didn't have time to do something. Too close to another item in my itinerary,
unable to schedule because I was waiting on someone else's schedule, people weren't available, businesses/parks weren't open yet, inclement weather,
needing to schedule something in advance, etc.

This is part of the reason why I played video games so often. It's easy to do with no notice or planning, can be played for anywhere between 5 and
500 minutes, and has so few requirements/dependencies (like weather or other people). I think video games are like snacks - easy to consume, but
that's specifically why you need to watch your consumption. It's easier to eat a handful of chips than a cutting up a healthy orange. If you want
to be healthier, you need to make the effort to have the orange some times. The same is true for time management, or making time for your priorities.
On the other hand, if you have time to kill, video games aren't the worst way to pass the time.

Other than my trip to Europe, most of the activities I sought out didn't *require* a sabbatical. Meditating, playing basketball in the park,
boating. And in fact, even if I were retired, even with perfect weather, I couldn't do some of these things every day. Sunburn, fatigue, or injury
would eventually limit me. Even with all the time I could want, I'd only spend a couple hours at most doing these things. There's two takeaways
here:
1. There's no reason I can't continue doing most of these things once I'm back at work. I just need to prioritize them, make time for them
2. There's enough time where I *can't* do what I want (bad weather, personally unable, other people unavailable) that I might as well be working.
So while *not* working 40 hours creates a lot of opportunity for other activities, but some of that 40 hours wasn't going to be available
anyway

Speaking of priorities, my sabbatical gave me the time and space to reflect more than I ever have before. I didn't build a daily meditation practice
in the sense of sitting in silence, but the daily writing has created a mechanism for reflection. I still can't calm my mind on a whim like some
practitioners can, but I feel I hit important milestones. I reached a calmness of mind that felt natural, one that felt easier and more relaxed.
This was my "kensh≈ç," my moment of clarity (albeit short). I've reflected on my duty to other people and feel a logical and natural obligation to
the common good.

### Outcomes

At the beginning of my sabbatical, I tried to define some outcomes I wanted to get from my time. Time to review

#### Hypothesis 1 - retired life is great

I was pretty confident in this hypothesis, and for all intents and purposes retired life is amazing. But I did learn a few things.
Not working doesn't mean you're free from, or immune to, interpersonal conflict. You are still subject to negative emotions like
frustration, anxiety, and sadness. It still takes effort and planning to connect with family and friends, even if you're schedule is
wide open. Not working isn't a silver bullet for everything. Hell it's not a silver bullet for _anything_.

For me, I think retired life is great because
* You get 40+ hours per week to do whatever you want. Out of ~100 walking hours, that's substantial. Time to do new things, or just do
_more_ of the things you already do
* You introduce slack into your schedule. Even on my more structured days, there was some unallocated time. I think this slack was
extremely valuable in reducing stress, by creating a sense of time affluence
* It removes some of the common stressors of work (timelines/due dates, interpersonal conflict)


#### Hypothesis 2 - my anxiety is strictly work related

Mixed results here. Work is definitely a major contributor to my anxiety. However I wasn't 100% anxiety free while on sabbatical either.
I do think the sabbatical acted as a good reset - I scored much better on a recent anxiety test, and I have more clarity about the
role of my job in my life. Time will tell if I can maintain my new perspective, or if I'll simply fall back to old patterns.

In the last couple days, I have had some anxious moments while thinking about work. These stressful thoughts are mostly about fear of
failure, of being competent and able to do my job. Coincidentally, I was just reading about [Self-Determination Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory) (SDT).
The TL;DR is that "SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth" which are autonomy, competence
(Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery), and relatedness. I previoiusly wrote about how making pizzas might be a more
satisfying job, because you make so many pizzas you will inevitably attain some level of mastery. SDT is more about motivation, so
maybe this is more about [Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Esteem_needs) - 
feeling of mastery is one of the "esteem" needs. Either way, my point is this - I think the ongoing challenge of my work, the uncertainty of
it, is the underlying problem I have with my job. I think there is some legitimacy to this, but I also think it's a perspective problem. I
don't have mastery when compared to some, but I do have a pretty deep skillset in a *shitload* of domains. So my skill is being able to
jump into shit I don't have mastery of, and still add value. I will be reiterating this sentiment to myself to try to fight off the
self-doubt surrounding my job.

#### Get fit

Calling this one a success. I exercised in some fashion nearly every day, sometimes for hours. I'm sure I look the same, but I've definitely
built some muscle. I should be doing more strenuous cardio but this is still progress.

Sidenote - my activity level is definitely correlated with the weather. That strategy won't suffice in a place like Wisconsin, so I need
to spend some time and brain power on how to stay active.

#### Hablo Espanol

I slipped on this goal after the first third of my time. I wasn't doing any lessons while I was traveling (which was the plan) but I didn't
hit the ground running when I got back. Scheduling the lesson seemed like a conflict with other stuff I wanted to do, and I kept pushing it
off. My goal was 5 hours of tutoring, of which I completed 2.5. That's OK - I think being bilingual will always be out of reach for me, but I'm
going to finish the remaining 2.5 hours on principal.

#### Disconnect

Mostly successful here. I rarely used a computer for anything. I did succumb to scrolling through reddit or reading articles suggested my Google
a few times. But overall I really enjoyed flushing my brain of computer problems and not getting sucked into the internet content machine. I
plan to keep scrolling out of my life, try to replace it with journaling on my phone or pushups. If I've got time to scroll, it means I've got
time to be doing something more valuable to me.

# Closing

What a sabbatical. It was amazing on multiple levels. I really appreciate my employer for offering this opportunity. It is a milestone in
my life that I won't forget.
