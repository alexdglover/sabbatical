Day 20 was a busy day. Still struggling with sleep. This is the strangest jet lag - I can fall asleep fine, but wake up at like 1AM for a few hours. Fortunately the lack of sleep didn't phase me.
We got up, packed up, and checked out of the hotel. Before leaving the grounds, we had a pizza making lesson from the chef at the resort, Andrea, with the help of a translator, Diletta.
The dough needs to rest at least 24 hours, so the dough had to be made ahead of time. I still learned a lot. The staff were super friendly, we got to eat the pizzas we made for lunch. We got a copy of the recipe
and some custom aprons as souvenirs. The staff half joked about sending photos when we tried the recipe at home, and I think I will.

Thoughts about working in the food industry.

After eating our pizza, we hopped in the Mini and started the drive to Lake Garda. It was about 4 hours of driving, mostly uneventful. Our hotel was in the area called Gardone, and we got glimpses of the lake as
we drove into town. The area is full of flowering plants and trees, with trimmed hedges lining everything. It looks like the whole town
has been manicuring the plants for years and years. Our room had amazing views of the lake and skyline.

We checked out the hotel grounds and walked the lakefront boardwalk after getting settled. I hadn't gotten my pizza fix yet, so I ordered a"favolosa" pizza for dinner. It listed a few vegetables
Ana "tunny green" as toppings so I assumed it was vegetarian. Turns out it was tuna. I scraped it off and still ate the whole pizza. There were lots of happy people and kids running around.
When we walked back the sky had turned pink, and the lake was picking up the color from the sky.

I slept well that night.
