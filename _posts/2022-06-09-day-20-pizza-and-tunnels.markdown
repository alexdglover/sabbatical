Day 20 was a busy day. Still struggling with sleep. This is the strangest jet lag - I can fall asleep fine, but wake up at like 1AM for a few hours. Fortunately the lack of sleep didn't phase me.
We got up, packed up, and checked out of the hotel. Before leaving the grounds, we had a pizza making lesson from the chef at the resort, Andrea, with the help of a translator, Diletta.
The dough needs to rest at least 24 hours, so the dough had to be made ahead of time. I still learned a lot. The staff were super friendly, we got to eat the pizzas we made for lunch. We got a copy of the recipe
and some custom aprons as souvenirs. The staff half joked about sending photos when we tried the recipe at home, and I think I will.

After eating our pizza, we hopped in the Mini and started the drive to Lake Garda. It was about 4 hours of driving, mostly uneventful. The roads highways in northern Italy
have a *lot* of tunnels, more than I ever would have imagined. These are huge tunnels, 4 lanes wide, going 130 km/h. Lots of tunnels and bridges made for an interesting drive.

Our hotel was in the area called Gardone, and we got glimpses of the lake as
we drove into town. The area is full of flowering plants and trees, with trimmed hedges lining everything. It looks like the whole town
has been manicuring the plants for years and years. Our room had amazing views of the lake and skyline.

We checked out the hotel grounds and walked the lakefront boardwalk after getting settled. I hadn't gotten my pizza fix yet, so I ordered a"favolosa" pizza for dinner. It listed a few vegetables
Ana "tunny green" as toppings so I assumed it was vegetarian. Turns out it was tuna. I scraped it off and still ate the whole pizza. There were lots of happy people and kids running around.
When we walked back the sky had turned pink, and the lake was picking up the color from the sky.

I slept well that night.

## What do I like about simple jobs

Tangent about making pizza, or any other similar jobs. These jobs are appealing to me, and I think sussing out the details will be insightful. First off, there are lots of iterations in a short amount of time. In
the time that I complete one project at work, Andrea has probably made hundreds of pizzas. A line cook has probably made a metric ton of hash browns. I think this repetition is an opportunity to master a skill.
The trade-off is that cooking the same food day in and day out could definitely get boring. Things change so fast in software that I haven't had a lot of opportunities to focus on one tool or language in awhile.
I bounce around from project to project, picking up whatever skills I need as I go. The variety is good, but the absence of authority or expertise makes things uncomfortable. Arguably being uncomfortable is good,
and having to pivot frequently is part of becoming more senior in the software industry. But it's still a worthwhile observation that I'd prefer more mastery.

The second aspect of these jobs that sounds appealing is the existing consensus and procedures. The cooks don't get
together at the beginning of every shift to decide the best way to make a pizza. It's already established. There might be some variance in technique or style, but these fit into the error margin and therefore
don't matter. Again, the lack of creativity or freedom might make it more boring, but I don't think that would bother me. I think the absence of debate would lead to more autonomy and be a net positive overall.

I'm going to take these insights and see how I can tailor my current job and career to incorporate more of these "simple living" attributes.
