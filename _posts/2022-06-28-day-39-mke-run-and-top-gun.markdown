* 0700 - played video games
* 0800 - had a quick bowl of cereal, then worked the pizza dough I started the day before.
The dough is leavening at room temperature now. The dough is quite heavy and thick, really hoping
it lightens up as it rises
* 0900 - hit the road, heading towards my mom's house in Greenfield. Picked up some coffee on the way
* 1030 - hung out with my Mom and chatted. Took care of some minor chores for her (she's still recovering
from knee surgery. Sat outside on her patio for awhile and chatted some more. Grabbed lunch, had a taco
salad. Helped my Mom with one more task before hitting the road
* 1400 - drove back to Madison, got gas on the way back
* 1530 - finished prepping the pizza dough. Now I have one pizzas worth of dough in the fridge for dinner
this week and two more in the freezer
* 1600 - went on a walk with Cassie
* 1630 - short yoga
* 1700 - shaved my head and showered
* 1800 - drove to the theater. Cassie and I got vegetarian chicken nuggets and fries and watched the new
Top Gun movie. Another decent movie, good theater experience
* 2130 - watched a bit of TV before crashing at 2230
