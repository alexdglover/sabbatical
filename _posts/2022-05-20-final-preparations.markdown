My wife Cassie was out of town Monday and Tuesday, and it was sort of an unplanned dry run for my sabbatical. I still had to go to work in
the daytime, but I had no commitments, no obligations in the evenings. Results were mixed - the first night I quit working at 5, then spent
the rest of the night drinking beer, eating too many corn chips, and I watched the entirety of the new 3 hour long
[The Batman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/). The second night I had to work until 18:30, I quickly had a light meal of some ramen,
and then I spent a couple hours on some home repair work. This dataset is too small to be practical, but 50% hedonism, 50% work is a bit
disappointing. In particular, my knee jerk reaction to fall into hedonism is alarming.

I don't want to plan out my sabbatical in great detail, because the freedom to be spontaneous and flexible is one of the key benefits.
But I also don't want to fall into the path of least resistance and be a bum for 6 weeks. So I'm going to to create a "fallback" plan
for any given day. If I'm inspired or have something particular I want to do, I'll just do it. No plan needed. But if I'm wandering a bit
or feeling uninspired, I'll have this fallback plan of activities.

* 0700 - Meditation
* 0800 - Light exercise. Yoga, stretching, body weight exercises
* 0900 - Walk outside while [paying attention](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097583787/jenny-odell-how-to-pay-attention-tips-comic)
* 0930 - Walk to a local grocery store for fresh produce for breakfast
* 1000 - Call, text, email family/friends just to say hi
* 1100 - Start preparing an awesome lunch
* 1200 - Eat awesome lunch!
* 1300 - Walk to [Brittingham Park](https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/find-a-park/park.cfm?id=1139) and either rent a boat or play basketball
* 1500 - Do a Spanish lesson with a tutor
* 1600 - Listen to podcasts, audiobooks, or read
* 1700 - Start preparing an awesome dinner
* 1800 - Eat an awesome dinner!
* 1900 - Write a quick blog post about the day so far
* 2000 - Hang out with Cassie
* 2230 - Go to bed


The exercise of creating this list was actually insightful. Sixteen waking hours with no commitment is actually hard to fill. But I'm also
really excited about how much stuff I want to do, and how much stuff I could cram into a single day.

Today is Friday, so tomorrow will be the beginning of the experiment. I've wrapped up everything I could at work, I'm leaving my projects
in a stable state and in good hands. All of the final preparations are complete. I'm very excited. Not just for the time off, but I really
think I'm going to feel better and learn a lot about myself with this time off. [And awaaaaay we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQdVo121o8).
