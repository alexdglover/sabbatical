Hey! Iâ€™m Alex. I work at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/), and one of the best (unofficial) benefits is that employees get a six week
sabbatical after five years. I hit my five years in January 2022, and I was able to schedule my sabbatical starting May 23. And I want to
make the most of it, so I've decided to start this dedicated blog as a way to keep me accountable and as a creative outlet.

Who's this going to read this blog? Probably nobody but me! This is more like a personal journal, but static web sites are cooler than
paper so here we are. That, and there's a small chance someone on the internet will find something useful.

My 6 week sabbatical technically starts on May 23, but if we include the weekends it starts on Saturday, May 21, and goes through Monday,
July 5. That's 45 days to have fun, reflect, and do all the things I think I don't have time for during normal work weeks.
